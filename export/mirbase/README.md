# miRBase pre-miRNA

The miRBase Sequence Database is a searchable database of published miRNA sequences and annotation. The data were previously provided by the miRNA Registry. Each entry in the miRBase Sequence database represents a predicted hairpin portion of a miRNA transcript (termed mir in the database), with information on the location and sequence of the mature miRNA sequence (termed miR).
