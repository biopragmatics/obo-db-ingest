1024	DNA glycosylases	DNA glycosylases are a family of enzymes involved in base excision repair, classified under EC number EC 3.2.2. Base excision repair is the mechanism by which damaged bases in DNA are removed and replaced. DNA glycosylases catalyze the first step of this process. They remove the damaged nitrogenous base while leaving the sugar-phosphate backbone intact, creating an apurinic/apyrimidinic site, commonly referred to as an AP site. This is accomplished by flipping the damaged base out of the double helix followed by cleavage of the N- glycosidic bond.  Glycosylases were first discovered in bacteria, and have since been found in all kingdoms of life. In addition to their role in base excision repair DNA glycosylase enzymes have been implicated in the repression of gene silencing in A. thaliana, N. tabacum and other plants by active demethylation. 5-methylcytosine residues are excised and replaced with unmethylated cytosines allowing access to the chromatin structure of the enzymes and proteins necessary for transcription and subsequent translation.  			so:0005855

1026	MutS homologs	Mismatch repair contributes to the overall fidelity of DNA replication and is essential for combating the adverse effects of damage to the genome. It involves the correction of mismatched base pairs that have been missed by the proofreading element ( Klenow fragment ) of the DNA polymerase complex. The post-replicative Mismatch Repair System (MMRS) of Escherichia coli involves MutS (Mutator S), MutL and MutH proteins, and acts to correct point mutations or small insertion/deletion loops produced during DNA replication.  MutS and MutL are involved in preventing recombination between partially homologous DNA sequences. The assembly of MMRS is initiated by MutS, which recognizes and binds to mispaired nucleotides and allows further action of MutL and MutH to eliminate a portion of newly synthesized DNA strand containing the mispaired base.  MutS can also collaborate with methyltransferases in the repair of O(6)-methylguanine damage, which would otherwise pair with thymine during replication to create an O(6)mG:T mismatch.  MutS exists as a dimer, where the two monomers have different conformations and form a heterodimer at the structural level.  Only one monomer recognises the mismatch specifically and has ADP bound. Non-specific major groove DNA-binding domains from both monomers embrace the DNA in a clamp-like structure. Mismatch binding induces ATP uptake and a conformational change in the MutS protein, resulting in a clamp that translocates on DNA. MutS is a modular protein with a complex structure,  and is composed of: N-terminal mismatch-recognition domain, which is similar in structure to tRNA endonuclease. Connector domain, which is similar in structure to Holliday junction resolvase ruvC. Core domain, which is composed of two separate subdomains that join together to form a helical bundle; from within the core domain, two helices act as levers that extend towards (but do not touch) the DNA. Clamp domain, which is inserted between the two subdomains of the core domain at the top of the lever helices; the clamp domain has a beta-sheet structure. ATPase domain (connected to the core domain), which has a classical Walker A motif. HTH (helix-turn-helix) domain, which is involved in dimer contacts.  Homologues of MutS have been found in many species including eukaryotes (MSH 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 proteins), archaea and bacteria, and together these proteins have been grouped into the MutS family. Although many of these proteins have similar activities to the E. coli MutS, there is significant diversity of function among the MutS family members. This diversity is even seen within species, where many species encode multiple MutS homologues with distinct functions.  Inter-species homologues may have arisen through frequent ancient horizontal gene transfer of MutS (and MutL) from bacteria to archaea and eukaryotes via endosymbiotic ancestors of mitochondria and chloroplasts.  .

1032	Cullins	Cullins are a family of hydrophobic proteins providing a scaffold for ubiquitin ligases (E3). All eukaryotes appear to have cullins. They combine with RING proteins to form Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) that are highly diverse and play a role in myriad cellular processes.  The human genome contains eight cullin genes  CUL1, part of SCF complex CUL2, part of ECS complex ( Elongin C - CUL2 - SOCS-box ) CUL3, part of CUL3-BTB complex CUL4A CUL4B CUL5 CUL7 CUL9, also known as PARC  There is also a more distant member called ANAPC2 (or APC2), part of the Anaphase-promoting complex. CUL1, 2, 3, 4A, 4B, 5 and 7 each form part of a multi-subunit ubiquitin complex. Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs), such as Cul1 (SCF) play an essential role in targeting proteins for ubiquitin-mediated destruction; as such, they are diverse in terms of composition and function, regulating many different processes from glucose sensing and DNA replication to limb patterning and circadian rhythms.  The catalytic core of CRLs consists of a RING protein and a cullin family member. For Cul1, the C-terminal cullin-homology domain binds the RING protein. The RING protein appears to function as a docking site for ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s). Other proteins contain a cullin-homology domain, such as CUL9, also known as p53 cytoplasmic anchor PARC, and the ANAPC2 subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome; both CUL9 and ANAPC2 have ubiquitin ligase activity. The N-terminal region of cullins is more variable, and is used to interact with specific adaptor proteins.    With the exception of ANAPC2, each member of the cullin family is modified by Nedd8 and several cullins function in Ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, a process in which the 26S proteasome recognises and subsequently degrades a target protein tagged with K48-linked poly-ubiquitin chains. Nedd8CUL1-F-box protein) E3 Ub ligase complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast), and Nedd8 modification has now emerged as a regulatory pathway of fundamental importance for cell cycle control and for embryogenesis in metazoans. The only identified Nedd8 substrates are cullins. Neddylation results in covalent conjugation of a Nedd8 moiety onto a conserved cullin lysine residue. 	CUL		so:0005855

All family members contain multiple transmembrane domains and most carry two conserved residues which might be active-site residues, a conserved histidine (His) embedded in a hydrophobic stretch of residues and an asparagine (Asn) or histidine within a more hydrophilic region some 30-50 residues upstream.  MBOAT enzymes catalyze the transfer of an acyl group from acyl-coenzyme to one of several different substrates. The family is found from bacteria to eukaryotes, and the active region lies outside the membrane.  The family may be grouped into four categories, according to function:	MBOAT		so:0005855

1042	5'-nucleotidases	5'-nucleotidase ( EC 3.1.3.5 ) is an enzyme which catalyzes the phosphorylytic cleavage of 5'nucleotides.  Although originally found in snake venom,  the activity of 5'nucleotidase has been described for bacteria and plant cells, and is widely distributed in vertebrate tissue.  In mammalian cells the enzyme is predominantly located in the plasma membrane and its primary role is in the conversion of extracellular nucleotides (e.g. 5'-AMP), which are generally impermeable, to the corresponding nucleoside (e.g. adenosine) which can readily enter most cells.  Consequently, the enzyme plays a key role in the metabolism of nucleotides. The enzyme has a wide substrate specificity for nucleotides and has been shown to hydrolyze 5'nucleotides rapidly, ribose-5-phosphate slowly, and other phosphate esters extremely slowly (if at all).

1049	RecQ like helicases	RecQ helicase is a family of helicase enzymes initially found in Escherichia coli  that has been shown to be important in genome maintenance.    They function through catalyzing the reaction ATP + H 2 O â†’ ADP + P and thus driving the unwinding of paired DNA and translocating in the 3' to 5' direction. These enzymes can also drive the reaction NTP + H 2 O â†’ NDP + P to drive the unwinding of either DNA or RNA.	RECQL		hgnc.genegroup:1167	
105	Yip1 domain containing		YIPF		hgnc.genegroup:1144	
1050	Topoisomerases	Topoisomerases are enzymes that regulate the overwinding or underwinding of DNA. The winding problem of DNA arises due to the intertwined nature of its double-helical structure. During DNA replication and transcription, DNA becomes overwound ahead of a replication fork. If left unabated, this tension would eventually stop the ability of the enzymes involved in these processes to continue down the DNA strand. In order to prevent and correct these types of topological problems caused by the double helix, topoisomerases bind to either single-stranded or double-stranded DNA and cut the phosphate backbone of the DNA. This intermediate break allows the DNA to be untangled or unwound, and, at the end of these processes, the DNA backbone is resealed again. Since the overall chemical composition and connectivity of the DNA do not change, the tangled and untangled DNAs are chemical isomers, differing only in their global topology, thus their name. Topoisomerases are isomerase enzymes that act on the topology of DNA.  Bacterial topoisomerase and human topoisomerase proceed via the same mechanism for replication and transcription.	TOP		so:0005855	
1051	Nucleoporins	The nucleoporins are a family of proteins which are the constituent building blocks of the nuclear pore complex (NPC).  The nuclear pore complex is a massive structure that extends across the nuclear envelope, forming a gateway that regulates the flow of macromolecules between the cell nucleus and the cytoplasm. Nuclear pores in turn allow the transport of water-soluble molecules across the nuclear envelope. Nucleoporins, a family of around 30 proteins, are the main components of the nuclear pore complex in eukaryotic cells. Nucleoporin 62 is the most abundant member of this family.  Nucleoporins are able to transport molecules across the nuclear envelope at a very high rate. A single NPC is able to transport 60,000 protein molecules across the nuclear envelope every minute.

1053	14-3-3 phospho-serine/phospho-threonine binding proteins	14-3-3 proteins are a family of conserved regulatory molecules that are expressed in all eukaryotic cells. 14-3-3 proteins have the ability to bind a multitude of functionally diverse signaling proteins, including kinases, phosphatases, and transmembrane receptors. More than 200 signaling proteins have been reported as 14-3-3 ligands. The name 14-3-3 refers to the particular elution and migration pattern of these proteins on DEAE -cellulose chromatography and starch-gel electrophoresis. The 14-3-3 proteins eluted in the 14th fraction of bovine brain homogenate and were found on positions 3.3 of subsequent electrophoresis by Moore and Perez (1967). Elevated amounts of 14-3-3 proteins are found in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. 	YWHA		so:0005855	
1054	Ribosomal proteins	A ribosomal protein is any of the proteins that, in conjunction with rRNA, make up the ribosomal subunits involved in the cellular process of translation. A large part of the knowledge about these organic molecules has come from the study of E. coli ribosomes. Most ribosomal proteins have been isolated and specific antibodies have been produced. These, together with electronic microscopy and the use of certain reactives, have allowed for the determination of the topography of the proteins in the ribosome. E.coli, other bacteria and Archaea have a 30S small subunit and a 50S large subunit, whereas humans and yeasts have a 40S small subunit and a 60S large subunit.  Equivalent subunits are frequently numbered differently between bacteria, Archaea, yeasts and humans. 			so:0005855

1056	TNF receptor associated factors	TNF receptor associated factors also known as TRAFs are a family of proteins primarily involved in the regulation of inflammation, antiviral responses and apoptosis.  Currently, seven TRAF proteins have been characterized in mammals : TRAF1, TRAF2, TRAF3, TRAF4, TRAF5, TRAF6 and TRAF7. Except for TRAF7, these proteins share a relatively conserved secondary structure, including a namesake C-terminal TRAF domain that mediates interactions with other signaling components such as the transmembrane TNF receptors and CD40.

1061	Mediator complex	Mediator is a multiprotein complex that functions as a transcriptional coactivator in all eukaryotes. It was discovered by Roger D. Kornberg, winner of the 2006 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. It is also referred to in scientific literature as the vitamin D receptor interacting protein ( DRIP ) coactivator complex and the thyroid hormone receptor-associated proteins ( TRAP ). The mediator complex is required for the successful transcription of nearly all class II gene promoters in yeast.  It works in the same manner in mammals. The human Mediator complex has 31+ subunits and is 1.2 MDa in size. Its large surface area provides great potential for proteinâ€“protein interaction, even though its sequences do not contain many predicted functional domains. Mediator has been shown to associate with general transcription factors, as well as RNA polymerase II, and is essential for activator-dependent transcription. It has also been demonstrated that the Mediator complex is involved in activator-independent transcription, implying that it may provide a fundamental control of the formation of the initiation complex.  Mediator functions as a coactivator and binds to the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II holoenzyme, acting as a bridge between this enzyme and transcription factors.  	MED		so:0005855

1109	Keratins	Keratin is a family of fibrous structural proteins. Keratin is the key structural material making up the outer layer of human skin. It is the key structural component of hair and nails, and it provides the necessary strength and toughness for masticatory organs, such as the tongue and the hard palate. Keratin monomers assemble into bundles to form intermediate filaments, which are tough and form strong unmineralized tissues found in reptiles, birds, amphibians, and mammals. The only other biological matter known to approximate the toughness of keratinized tissue is chitin.   	KRT		hgnc.genegroup:607

1111	ESCRT complexes	The endosomal sorting complexes required for transport ( ESCRT ) machinery is made up of cytosolic protein complexes, known as ESCRT-0, ESCRT-I, ESCRT-II, and ESCRT-III. Together with a number of accessory proteins, these ESCRT complexes enable a unique mode of membrane remodeling that results in membranes bending/budding away from the cytoplasm.   These ESCRT components have been isolated and studied in a number of organisms including yeast and humans.  The ESCRT machinery plays a vital role in a number of cellular processes including multivesicular body (MVB) biogenesis, cellular abscission, and viral budding. Multivesicular body (MVB) biogenesis is a process in which ubiquitin tagged proteins enter organelles called endosomes via the formation of vesicles. This process is essential for cells to destroy misfolded and damaged proteins.  Without ESCRT machinery, these proteins can build up and lead to neurodegenerative disease. For example, abnormalities in ESCRT-III components can lead to neurological disorders such as hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP).  Cellular abscission, the process by which the membrane connecting two daughter cells is cleaved, is also mediated by ESCRT machinery. Without the ESCRT complexes, daughter cells could not separate and abnormal cells containing twice the amount of DNA would be generated. These cells would inevitably be destroyed through a process known as apoptosis. Lastly, viral budding, or the process by which specific types of viruses exit cells, may not occur in the absence of ESCRT machinery. This would inevitably prevent viruses from spreading from cell to cell.			so:0005855

1113	Spectrins	Spectrin is a cytoskeletal protein that lines the intracellular side of the plasma membrane in eukaryotic cells. The protein is named spectrin since it was first isolated as a major protein component of human red blood cells which had been treated with mild detergents; the detergents lysed the cells and the hemoglobin and other cytoplasmic components were washed out. In the light microscope the basic shape of the red blood cell could still be seen as the spectrin containing submembranous cytoskeleton preserved the shape of the cell in outline. This became known as a red blood cell 'ghost', and so the major protein of the ghost was named spectrin. Spectrin forms pentagonal or hexagonal arrangements, forming a scaffolding and playing an important role in maintenance of plasma membrane integrity and cytoskeletal structure.  The hexagonal arrangements are formed by tetramers of spectrin subunits associating with short actin filaments at either end of the tetramer. These short actin filaments act as junctional complexes allowing the formation of the hexagonal mesh. In certain types of brain injury such as diffuse axonal injury, spectrin is irreversibly cleaved by the proteolytic enzyme calpain, destroying the cytoskeleton.  Spectrin cleavage causes the membrane to form blebs and ultimately to be degraded, usually leading to the death of the cell.  Spectrin subunits may also be cleaved by caspase family enzymes, and calpain and caspase produce different spectrin breakdown products which can be detected by western blotting with appropriate antibodies. Calpain cleavage may indicate activation of necrosis, while caspase cleavage may indicate apoptosis. 	SPT		so:0005855

They were initially discovered as being associated with specific caveolin-independent cholesterol- and glycosphingolipid-enriched membrane microdomains and as being expressed during axon regeneration.

1124	SNAREs	SNARE proteins (an acronym derived from ' SNAP (Soluble NSF Attachment Protein) REceptor') are a large protein superfamily.

The best studied SNAREs are those that mediate docking of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane in neurons. 			so:0005855	
1125	Xeroderma pigmentosum complementation groups	Xeroderma pigmentosum, or XP, is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder of DNA repair in which the ability to repair damage caused by ultraviolet (UV) light is deficient.  :574 In extreme cases, all exposure to sunlight must be forbidden, no matter how small; as such, individuals with the disease are often colloquially referred to as children of the night.  Multiple basal cell carcinomas (basaliomas) and other skin malignancies frequently occur at a young age in those with XP; metastatic malignant melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma  are the two most common causes of death in XP victims. This disease involves both sexes and all races, with an incidence of 1:250,000 in the United States.  XP is roughly six times more common in Japanese people  than in other groups. Normally, damage to DNA in epidermal cells occurs during exposure to UV light. The absorption of the high-energy light leads to the formation of pyrimidine dimers, namely cyclobutane-pyrimidine dimers and pyrimidine-6-4-pyrimidone photoproducts. In a healthy, normal human being, the damage is first excised by endonucleases. DNA polymerase then repairs the missing sequence, and ligase 'seals' the transaction. This process is known as nucleotide excision repair.	XP		hgnc.genegroup:1269

1138	Stathmins	Stathmin 1/oncoprotein 18, also known as STMN1, is a highly conserved 17 kDa protein. Its function as an important regulatory protein of microtubule dynamics has been well-characterized.  Eukaryotic microtubules are one of three major components of the cell's cytoskeleton. They are highly dynamic structures that continuously alternate between assembly and disassembly. Stathmin performs an important function in regulating rapid microtubule remodeling of the cytoskeleton in response to the cell's needs. Microtubules are cylindrical polymers of Î±,Î²-tubulin. Their assembly is in part determined by the concentration of free tubulin in the cytoplasm.  At low concentrations of free tubulin, the growth rate at the microtubule ends is slowed and results in an increased rate of depolymerization (disassembly).  	STMN		so:0005855

1140	Tropomodulins	Tropomodulin is a protein which binds and caps the minus end of actin (the 'pointed' end), regulating the length of actin filaments in muscle and non-muscle cells. The protein functions by physically blocking the spontaneous dissociation of ADP -bound actin monomers from the minus end of the actin fibre. This, along with plus end capping proteins, such as capZ stabilise the structure of the actin filament. End capping is particularly important when long-lived actin filaments are necessary, for example: in myofibrils. Inhibition of tropomodulin capping activity leads to dramatic increase in thin filament length from its pointed end. 	TMOD		so:0005855

1161	Taste 1 receptors	The TAS1R1+TAS1R3 heterodimer receptor functions as the savory receptor, responding to L-amino acid binding, especially L-glutamate. The umami taste is most frequently associated with the food additive monosodium glutamate (MSG) and can be enhanced through the binding of inosine monophosphate (IMP) and guanosine monophosphate (GMP) molecules.  The TAS1R2+TAS1R3 heterodimer receptor functions as the sweet receptor by binding to a wide variety of sugars and sugar substitutes. TAS1R2+3 expressing cells are found in circumvallate papillae and foliate papillae near the back of the tongue and palate taste receptor cells in the roof of the mouth.	TAS1R		hgnc.genegroup:289

They are motor proteins that move directionally along a nucleic acid phosphodiester backbone, separating two annealed nucleic acid strands (i.e., DNA, RNA, or RNA-DNA hybrid) using energy derived from ATP hydrolysis. There are many helicases resulting from the great variety of processes in which strand separation must be catalyzed. Approximately 1% of eukaryotic genes code for helicases.  The human genome codes for 95 non-redundant helicases: 64 RNA helicases and 31 DNA helicases.  Many cellular processes, such as DNA replication, transcription, translation, recombination, DNA repair, and ribosome biogenesis involve the separation of nucleic acid strands that necessitates the use of helicases.			so:0005855

1171	SCF complex	Skp, Cullin, F-box containing complex (or SCF complex ) is a multi-protein E3 ubiquitin ligase complex catalyzing the ubiquitination of proteins destined for proteasomal degradation. It has important roles in the ubiquitination of proteins involved in the cell cycle and also marks various other cellular proteins for destruction.  Core Components SCF contains three core subunits, and a number of less critical components:  F-box protein ( e.g. Cdc4 ) â€“ Contributes to the specificity of SCF by aggregating to target proteins independently of the complex and then binding to the Skp1 component, thus allowing the protein to be brought into proximity with the functional E2 protein. The F-box is also essential in regulating SCF activity during the course of the cell-cycle. SCF levels are thought to remain constant throughout the cell-cycle. Instead, F-box affinity for protein substrates is regulated through cdk/cyclin mediated phosphorylation of target proteins.  Skp1 â€“ Skp1 is a bridging protein and forms part of the horseshoe-shaped complex in tandem with cullin (cul1). Skp1 is essential in the recognition and binding of the F-box.  Cullin ( CUL1 ) â€“ CUL1 forms the major structural scaffold of the SCF complex and links the skp1 domain with the Rbx1 domain.  RBX1 â€“ Rbx1 contains a small zinc-binding domain called the RING Finger, to which the E2-ubiquitin conjugate binds, allowing the transferral of the ubiquitin to a lysine residue on the target protein.  SCF and Cell Cycle Regulation Progression through the cell cycle in eukaryotes is regulated through synthesisdephosphorylation of cell-cycle-regulating proteins. Two ubiquitin ligases are crucial in the cell cycle. The anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome ( APC/C ) controls the metaphase â€“ anaphase transition when bound to its substrate-specific activating subunit Cdc20 :  this complex ubiquitinylates the separase -inhibiting protein securin, paving the way for separase to break cohesin and thus separate the sister chromatids at the centromere. APC/C with another activating subunit, Cdh1, is active in G1 phase and controls levels of the mitosis-regulating B-type cyclins. SCF controls the transitions between G1/S and G2/M phases. Two F-box-protein-bound SCF complexes (SCF- Skp2 and SCF- Î²-TrCP ), are most well studied among over 70 F-box proteins identified in humans. SCF-Skp2 mainly ubiquitinates and degrades cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) such as p27 and p21 as well as the G1-/S-specific cyclin E, in vivo and in vitro.  Therefore, SCF-Skp2 promotes cell-cycle progression and cell growth.  On the other hand, SCF-Î²TrCP promotes proteolysis of Emi1, an APC/C-Cdh1 inhibitor, and Wee1, a Cdk1 inhibitor, in early mitosis via phosphorylation at their degron (the amino acid motif DSGXXS, where X can be any amino acid) by kinases such as Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) and Cdk1â€“cyclin B. SCF-Î²TrCP and APC/C control each other to regulate timely progression through the cell cycle.  Lists of substrates of SCF-Skp2 and -Î²TrCP are still growing. SCF and Plant Hormone Signaling In plants, the plant hormone auxin stimulates binding of SCF-TIR1 to the AUX/IAA repressor and then the degradation of the repressor, resulting in the activation of auxin-responsive genes. The TIR1 F-box protein acts as an auxin receptor and directly links reception of auxin to degradation of the Aux/IAA proteins. TIR1 (Transport Inhibitor Response 1) belongs to AFBs (Auxin Signaling F-box proteins).  In plants, the plant hormone Jasmonate allows binding between SCF-COI1 to the JAZ transcription factor. Degradation of the JAZ transcription factor allows for the transcription of the jasmonate responsive genes. 			so:0005855

1174	Lysozymes, c-type	Lysozymes, also known as muramidase or N-acetylmuramide glycanhydrolase, are glycoside hydrolases. These are enzymes ( EC 3.2.1.17 ) that damage bacterial cell walls by catalyzing hydrolysis of 1,4-beta-linkages between N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residues in a peptidoglycan and between N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residues in chitodextrins. Lysozyme is abundant in a number of secretions, such as tears, saliva, human milk, and mucus. It is also present in cytoplasmic granules of the macrophages and the polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs). Large amounts of lysozyme can be found in egg white. C-type lysozymes are closely related to alpha-lactalbumin in sequence and structure, making them part of the same family. In humans, the lysozyme enzyme is encoded by the LYZ gene.

1178	Diacylglycerol kinases	Diacylglycerol kinase (DGK or DAGK) is a family of enzymes that catalyzes the conversion of diacylglycerol (DAG) to phosphatidic acid (PA) utilizing ATP as a source of the phosphate. In non-stimulated cells, DGK activity is low allowing DAG to be used for glycerophospholipid biosynthesis but on receptor activation of the phosphoinositide pathway, DGK activity increases driving the conversion of DAG to PA. As both lipids are thought to function as bioactive lipid signaling molecules with distinct cellular targets, DGK therefore occupies an important position, effectively serving as a switch by terminating the signalling of one lipid while simultaneously activating signalling by another.  In bacteria, DGK is very small (13 to 15 kD) membrane protein which seems to contain three transmembrane domains.  The best conserved region is a stretch of 12 residues which are located in a cytoplasmic loop between the second and third transmembrane domains. Some Gram-positive bacteria also encode a soluble diacylglycerol kinase capable of reintroducing DAG into the phospholipid biosynthesis pathway. DAG accumulates in Gram-positive bacteria as a result of the transfer of glycerol-1-phosphate moieties from phosphatidylglycerol to lipotechoic acid. 	DGK		so:0005855

1218	LIM domain containing	LIM domains are protein structural domains, composed of two contiguous zinc finger domains, separated by a two- amino acid residue hydrophobic linker.  They are named after their initial discovery in the proteins L in11, I sl-1 & M ec-3.  LIM-domain containing proteins have been shown to play roles in cytoskeletal organisation, organ development and oncogenesis. LIM-domains mediate protein:protein interactions that are critical to cellular processes. LIM domains have highly divergent sequences, apart from certain key residues. The sequence divergence allow a great many different binding sites to be grafted onto the same basic domain. The conserved residues are those involved in zinc binding or the hydrophobic core of the protein. The sequence signature of LIM domains is as follows: - 2-4 -- 13-19 --- 2-4 ----- 2-4 -- 13-20 -C- 2-4 -     LIM domain organisation   LIM domains frequently occur in multiples, as seen in proteins such as TES, LMO4, and can also be attached to other domains in order to confer a binding or targeting function upon them, such as LIM-kinase. The LIM superclass of genes have been classified into 14 classes: ABLIM, CRP, ENIGMA, EPLIN, LASP, LHX, LMO, LIMK, LMO7, MICAL, PXN, PINCH, TES, and ZYX. Six of these classes (i.e., ABLIM, MICAL, ENIGMA, ZYX, LHX, LM07) originated in the stem lineage of animals, and this expansion is thought to have made a major contribution to the origin of animal multicellularity.  LIM domains are also found in various bacterial lineages where they are typically fused to a metallopeptidase domain. Some versions show fusions to an inactive P-loop NTPase at their N-terminus and a single transmembrane helix. These domain fusions suggest that the prokaryotic LIM domains are likely to regulate protein processing at the cell membrane. The domain architectural syntax is remarkable parallel to those of the prokaryotic versions of the B-box zinc finger and the AN1 zinc finger domains. 			hgnc.genegroup:26	
1219	Troponin complex subunits	Troponin is a complex of three regulatory proteins ( troponin C, troponin I, and troponin T ) that is integral to muscle contraction  in skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle, but not smooth muscle. Discussions of troponin often pertain to its functional characteristics  and/or to its usefulness as a diagnostic marker  or therapeutic target  for various heart disorders in particular as a highly specific marker for myocardial infarction or heart muscle cell death.

1220	PDZ domain containing	The PDZ domain is a common structural domain of 80-90 amino-acids found in the signaling proteins of bacteria, yeast, plants, viruses  and animals.  Proteins containing PDZ domains play a key role in anchoring receptor proteins in the membrane to cytoskeletal components. PDZ is an acronym combining the first letters of three proteins â€” post synaptic density protein (PSD95), Drosophila disc large tumor suppressor (Dlg1), and zonula occludens-1 protein (zo-1) â€” which were first discovered to share the domain.  PDZ domains have previously been referred to as DHR (Dlg homologous region)  or GLGF ( glycine - leucine -glycine- phenylalanine ) domains.  Proteins with these domains help hold together and organize signaling complexes at cellular membranes. Protein domains, connected by intrinsically disordered flexible linker regions, induce long-range allostery via protein domain dynamics.  PDZ domains also play a highly significant role in the anchoring of cell surface receptors (such as CFTR  and FZD7 ) to the actin cytoskeleton via mediators like NHERF and ezrin.  In general PDZ domains bind to a short region of the C-terminus of other specific proteins. These short regions bind to the PDZ domain by beta sheet augmentation. This means that the beta sheet in the PDZ domain is extended by the addition of a further beta strand from the tail of the binding partner protein. 	PDZ		so:0005855

1232	Bromodomain containing	A bromodomain is an approximately 110 amino acid protein domain that recognizes acetylated lysine residues, such as those on the N-terminal tails of histones. Bromodomains, as the â€œreadersâ€ of lysine acetylation, are responsible in transducing the signal carried by acetylated lysine residues and translating it into various normal or abnormal phenotypes.  Their affinity is higher for regions where multiple acetylation sites exist in proximity. This recognition is often a prerequisite for protein-histone association and chromatin remodeling. The domain itself adopts an all-Î± protein fold, a bundle of four alpha helices each separated by loop regions of variable lengths that form a hydrophobic pocket that recognizes the acetyl lysine.

1254	NF-kappa B complex subunits	NF-kappaB ( nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells ) is a protein complex that controls transcription of DNA, cytokine production and cell survival. NF-kappaB is found in almost all animal cell types and is involved in cellular responses to stimuli such as stress, cytokines, free radicals, ultraviolet irradiation, oxidized LDL, and bacterial or viral antigens. NF-kappaB plays a key role in regulating the immune response to infection (kappa light chains are critical components of immunoglobulins). Incorrect regulation of NF-kappaB has been linked to cancer, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, septic shock, viral infection, and improper immune development. NF-kappaB has also been implicated in processes of synaptic plasticity and memory.     			so:0005855

It is one of the most active P-TEFb-containing complexes required for rapid transcriptional induction in the presence or absence of paused Pol II. The SEC was found to regulate the transcriptional elongation checkpoint control (TECC) stage of transcription, and misregulation of this stage is associated with cancer pathogenesis. 			so:0005855	
1281	P-TEFb complex subunits	The positive transcription elongation factor, P-TEFb, plays an essential role in the regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) in eukaryotes. Immediately following initiation Pol II becomes trapped in promoter proximal paused positions on the majority of human genes. P-TEFb is a cyclin dependent kinase that can phosphorylate the DRB sensitivity inducing factor (DSIF) and negative elongation factor (NELF), as well as the carboxyl terminal domain of the large subunit of Pol II and this causes the transition into productive elongation leading to the synthesis of mRNAs. P-TEFb is regulated in part by a reversible association with the 7SK snRNP. Treatment of cells with the P-TEFb inhibitors DRB or flavopidirol leads to loss of mRNA production and ultimately cell death.			hgnc.genegroup:1280

In other words, aminoacyl tRNA synthetase simply attaches the appropriate, or 'cognate,' amino acid onto the corresponding tRNA. This is sometimes called 'charging' or 'loading' the tRNA with the amino acid.

1305	NuRD complex subunits	In the field of molecular biology, the Mi-2NuRD was the only known protein complex coupling chromatin remodeling ATPase and chromatin deacetylation enzymatic functions.  The NuRD complex contains seven subunits: the histone deacetylase core proteins HDAC1 and HDAC2, the histone-binding proteins RbAp46 and RbAp48, the metastasis-associated proteins MTA1 (or MTA2 / MTA3 ), the methyl-CpG-binding domain protein MBD3 (or MBD2 ) and the chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein CHD3 (aka Mi-2alpha) or CHD4 (aka Mi-2beta). The histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2 and the histone binding proteins RbAp48 and RbAp46 form a core complex shared between NuRD and Sin3-histone deacetylase complexes.   Overexpression of Mbd3, a subunit of NuRD, inhibits induction of iPSCs. Depletion of Mbd3, on the other hand, improves reprogramming efficiency,   that results in deterministic and synchronized iPS cell reprogramming (near 100% efficiency within seven days from mouse and human cells).  			hgnc.genegroup:2102

Different studies have identified additional interaction partners including MeCP2 (methyl-CpG-binding protein), RBP1 (RB-binding protein), BRMS1 (breast cancer metastasis suppressor), ING1/2 (inhibitor of growth), SAP25, SAP130, and SAP180, as well as the histone demethylase RBP2/KDM5A (Hayakawa and Nakayama, 2011 and Kadamb et al., 2013).			hgnc.genegroup:2102

1318	Non-canonical poly(A) polymerases	Polyadenylation of mitochondrial RNAs in higher eukaryotic organisms have diverse effects on their function and metabolism. Polyadenylation completes the UAA stop codon of a majority of mitochondrial mRNAs in mammals, regulates the translation of the mRNAs, and has diverse effects on their stability.   The addition of a poly(A) tail is catalyzed by poly(A) polymerases (PAPs). Nuclear PAPs that are involved in the 3′-end processing of pre-mRNAs have been studied extensively over the years. More recently, a collection of non-canonical PAPs (ncPAPs) has been identified, which are involved in polyadenylation in other organelles (as well as in the nucleus). Some of these ncPAPs have relaxed base selectivity and can also synthesize oligo- or poly-uridylate tails, and hence are also known as poly(U) polymerases (PUPs) or terminal uridylate transferases (TUTs or TUTases).			so:0005855

TTI1 (Tel two-interacting protein 1) and TTI2 are highly conserved regulators of the DDR in mammals, protect cells from spontaneous DNA damage and are required for the establishment of the intra-S and G2/M checkpoints.   TTI1 and TTI2 exist in multiple complexes, including a 2-MDa complex with TEL2 (telomere maintenance 2), called the Triple T complex, and phosphoinositide-3-kinase-related protein kinases (PIKKs) such as ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM).

1325	Synapsins	The synapsins are a family of proteins that have long been implicated in the regulation of neurotransmitter release at synapses. Specifically, they are thought to be involved in regulating the number of synaptic vesicles available for release via exocytosis at any one time.  Synapsins are present in invertebrates and vertebrates and are somewhat homologous across evaluated vertebrates. Current studies suggest the following hypothesis for the role of synapsin: synapsins bind synaptic vesicles to components of the cytoskeleton which prevents them from migrating to the presynaptic membrane and releasing neurotransmitter. During an action potential, synapsins are phosphorylated by PKA (cAMP dependent protein kinase), releasing the synaptic vesicles and allowing them to move to the membrane and release their neurotransmitter. Gene knockout studies in mice (where the mouse is unable to produce synapsin) have had some surprising results. Mice lacking all three synapsins are prone to seizures, and experience learning defects.  These results suggest that while synapsins are not essential for synaptic function, they do serve an important modulatory role. Conversely, studies using transgenic mice in which neuronal signaling is abolished in specific circuitries showed that synaptic activity regulates, but is not essential to maintain, the expression of these proteins.

1332	MTOR complex 1	mTORC1, also known as mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 or mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1, is a protein complex that functions as a nutrientredox sensor and controls protein synthesis.    This complex embodies the classic functions of mTOR, namely as a nutrient/energy/redox sensor and controller of protein synthesis.   The activity of this complex is regulated by rapamycin, insulin, growth factors, phosphatidic acid, certain amino acids and their derivatives (e.g. L -leucine and β-hydroxy β-methylbutyric acid ), mechanical stimuli, and oxidative stress.     The role of mTORC1 is to activate translation of proteins. In order for cells to grow and proliferate by manufacturing more proteins, the cells must ensure that they have the resources available for protein production. Thus, for protein production, and therefore mTORC1 activation, cells must have adequate energy resources, nutrient availability, oxygen abundance, and proper growth factors in order for mRNA translation to begin. 			so:0005855

In mammals and other eukaryotes, telomeric DNA consists of double- and single-stranded TTAGGG repeats and a single-stranded, G-rich overhang. Subunits of shelterin bind to these regions and induce the formation of a t-loop, a cap structure that deters DNA-damage-sensing machinery from mistakenly repairing telomeres. The absence of shelterin causes telomere uncapping and thereby activates damage-signaling pathways that may lead to non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), homology directed repair (HDR),  senescence, or apoptosis. 			so:0005855

1341	Apoptosome	The apoptosome is a large quaternary protein structure formed in the process of apoptosis. Its formation is triggered by the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria in response to an internal (intrinsic) or external (extrinsic) cell death stimulus. Stimuli can vary from DNA damage and viral infection to developmental cues such as those leading to the degradation of a tadpole's tail. In mammalian cells, once cytochrome c is released, it binds to the cytosolic protein Apaf-1 to facilitate the formation of apoptosome. An early biochemical study suggests a two-to-one ratio of cytochrome c to apaf-1 for apoptosome formation. However, recent structural studies suggest the cytochrome c to apaf-1 ratio is one-to-one. It has also been shown that the nucleotide dATP as third component binds to apaf-1, however its exact role is still debated. The mammalian apoptosome had never been crystallized, but a human APAF-1/cytochrome-c apoptosome has been imaged at lower (2 nm ) resolution by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy 10 years ago,  revealing a wheel-like particle with 7-fold symmetry. Recently, a medium resolution (9.5 Ã…ngstrÃ¶m) structure of human apoptosome was also solved by cryo-electron microscopy, which allows unambiguous inference for positions of all the APAF-1 domains (CARD, NBARC and WD40) and cytochrome c. There is also now a crystal structure of the monomeric, inactive Apaf-1 subunit (PDB 3SFZ).   Once formed, the apoptosome can then recruit and activate the inactive pro-caspase-9. Once activated, this initiator caspase can then activate effector caspases and trigger a cascade of events leading to apoptosis.			so:0005855	
1342	Death inducing signaling complex 	The death-inducing signaling complex or DISC is a multi-protein complex formed by members of the 'death receptor' family of apoptosis -inducing cellular receptors.  A typical example is FasR, which forms the DISC upon trimerization as a result of its ligand ( FasL ) binding. The DISC is composed of the death receptor, FADD, and caspase 8. It transduces a downstream signal cascade resulting in apoptosis. The Fas ligands, or cytotoxicity-dependent APO-1-associated proteins, physically associate with APO-1 (also known as the Fas receptor, or CD95), a tumor necrosis factor containing a functional death domain. This association leads to the formation of the DISC, thereby inducing apoptosis.  The entire process is initiated when the cell registers the presence of CD95L, the cognate ligand for APO-1.  Upon binding, the CAP proteins and procaspase-8 (composed of FLICE, MACH, and Mch5) bind to CD95 through death domain and death effector domain interactions. Procaspase-8 activation is thought to occur through a dimerization process with other procaspase-8 molecules, known as an induced proximity model. The CAP proteins associate only with the oligomerized version of APO-1 when forming the complex. The CAP1 are CAP2 proteins are also known as FADD/MORT1, an adaptor molecule with a death domain. CAP4 is also called FLICE, a cysteine protease with two death effector domains.  CAP3 is the prodomain of FLICE generated during proteolytic activation.  Once the DISC assembles, it allows APO-1 signaling to occur, which triggers cell death. In order to do this, downstream targets such as FLICE must be activated. In its inactive state, FLICE's two death domains are thought to bind together and prevent its activation. Once APO-1 aggregates within the cytosol, it recruits FADD, CAP3, and FLICE to the receptor, where FLICE is modified into several active subunits, which have the ability to cleave a variety of substrates. This proteolytic activity then results in a cascade of caspase activation, and ultimately cell death. This apoptotic activity is critical for tissue homeostasis and immune function. APO-1-mediated apoptosis can be inhibited by a variety of factors, including the viral caspase inhibitors CrmA and p35, as well as viral FLICE-inhibitory proteins known as v-FLIPs. When in the presence of APO-1, v-FLIPs preferentially bind and prevent procaspase-8 from being recruited; as such, apoptosis is stalled. Interestingly, humans have a homolog for v-FLIP known as c-FLIP, which occurs in two endogenous forms (c-FLIPL (long) and c-FLIPS (short)). These are similar in structure to procaspase-8, but lack the amino acids necessary for caspase-8 catalytic activity. It is thought that c-FLIP may be involved in modulating the immune system, as c-FLIPS is upregulated upon stimulation of the T cell receptor. Furthermore, as high expression of FLIP is known to promote tumor growth, these inhibitor molecules play a role in cancer proliferation. The DISC has been implicated as a possible drug development target for various cancers, including leukemia, glioma, and colon cancer. In glioma cells, the effects of TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) have been shown to induce DISC-mediated apoptosis. Specifically, TRAIL works by activating two death receptors, DR4 and DR5; these bind to FADD, which then interacts with caspase-8 to assemble the DISC. Tumor cells show varying sensitivity to TRAIL modulated apoptosis, depending on the presence of the antiapoptotic FLIP proteins.  Additionally, studies in leukemia have indicated that the histone deacetylase inhibitor LAQ824 increases apoptosis by decreasing the expression levels of the c-FLIPs.  As such, these inhibitors are promising targets for anti-cancer therapy.			so:0005855	
1343	CST complex	The CST complex localizes specifically to single-stranded telomeric DNA, including the telomeric overhang. In yeast this complex is involved in chromosome end capping and telomere length regulation. The capping properties of CST may be dispensable in vertebrates in vivo due to the presence of the shelterin complex, which also caps chromosome ends.   There is evidence to suggest that the CST complex  rescues stalled replication forks under conditions of replication stress.  			so:0005855	
1344	MRN complex	The MRN complex (MRX complex in yeast) is a protein complex consisting of Mre11, Rad50 and Nbs1 (also known as Nibrin  in humans and as Xrs2 in yeast). In eukaryotes, the MRN/X complex plays an important role in the initial processing of double-strand DNA breaks prior to repair by homologous recombination or non-homologous end joining. The MRN complex binds avidly to double-strand breaks both in vitro and in vivo and may serve to tether broken ends prior to repair by non-homologous end joining or to initiate resection prior to repair by homologous recombination. The MRN complex also participates in activating the checkpoint kinase ATM in response to DNA damage.   Production of short single-strand oligonucleotides by Mre11 endonuclease activity has been implicated in ATM activation by the MRN complex. 			so:0005855

135	Zinc fingers GRF-type	These genes encode proteins that contain Glycine-arginine-phenylalanine (GRF)-type zinc fingers (GRF-ZFs), 45- to 50-residue domains with a conserved GRxF motif. GRF-ZFs are widely distributed throughout eukaryotes in proteins that are involved in DNA damage response (DDR), transcriptional regulation, and RNA metabolism. GRF-ZFs are nucleic acid interaction modules and in several cases these motifs have been shown to enhance enzymatic activity.  This domain comprises a three-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet that folds into a crescent-shaped claw-like structure (5U6Z). A single bound Zn(2+) ion plays a central structural role in this domain, and is coordinated with tetrahedral geometry by a 'CHCC' sequence motif.	ZGRF		hgnc.genegroup:26

The CE is a cross-linked matrix that surrounds terminally differentiated squamous keratinocytes after a process known as cornification. CE precursor proteins are cross-linked by transglutaminases. The ratio of CE precursor proteins varies from tissue to tissue. In the epidermis, the most abundant CE component is loricrin (65-70%), while involucrin is a minor component (<5%).			hgnc.genegroup:1354

In humans, the complex is located on a 1.9 Mbp stretch within chromosome 1q 21.   The proteins encoded by EDC genes are closely related in terms of function, and evolutionarily they belong to three distinct gene families : the cornified envelope precursor family, the S100 protein family and the S100 fused type protein (SFTP) family.  It has been hypothesized that the clustering of EDC genes occurred due to duplication events which were evolutionarily favored during the adaptation to terrestrial environments.   EDC proteins have been involved in a variety of skin disorders including ichthyosis vulgaris, atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. 			so:0005855

Members are most often secreted and have an extracellular endocrine or paracrine function and are involved in processes including the regulation of extracellular matrix and branching morphogenesis, potentially as either proteases or protease inhibitors; in ion channel regulation in fertility ; as tumour suppressor or pro- oncogenic genes in tissues including the prostate ; and in cell-cell adhesion during fertilisation.   The overall protein structural conservation within the CAP superfamily results in fundamentally similar functions for the CAP domain in all members, yet the diversity outside of this core region dramatically alters the target specificity and, thus, the biological consequences.  			so:0005855

1455	Ferritin chains	Ferritin is a universal intracellular protein that stores iron and releases it in a controlled fashion. The protein is produced by almost all living organisms, including algae, bacteria, higher plants, and animals. In humans, it acts as a buffer against iron deficiency and iron overload.  Ferritin is found in most tissues as a cytosolic protein, but small amounts are secreted into the serum where it functions as an iron carrier. Plasma ferritin is also an indirect marker of the total amount of iron stored in the body, hence serum ferritin is used as a diagnostic test for iron-deficiency anemia.  Ferritin is a globular protein complex consisting of 24 protein subunits forming a nanocage with multiple metalâ€“protein interactions.  It is the primary intracellular iron-storage protein in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, keeping iron in a soluble and non-toxic form. Ferritin that is not combined with iron is called apoferritin.			so:0005855

1458	Non-receptor tyrosine kinases	Non-receptor tyrosine kinases (nRTKs) are cytoplasmic enzymes that are responsible for catalysing the transfer of a phosphate group from a nucleoside triphosphate donor, such as ATP, to tyrosine residues in proteins. Non-receptor tyrosine kinases are a subgroup of protein family tyrosine kinases, enzymes that can transfer the phosphate group from ATP to a tyrosine residue of a protein (phosphorylation). These enzymes regulate many cellular functions by switching on or switching off other enzymes in a cell. Unlike the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), the second subgroup of tyrosine kinases, the non-receptor tyrosine kinases are cytoplasmic enzymes. Thirty-two non-receptor tyrosine kinases have been identified in human cells ( EC 2.7.10.2 ). Non-receptor tyrosine kinases regulate cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, migration and apoptosis, and they are critical components in the regulation of the immune system.			so:0005855

1470	Glutathione S-transferases	Glutathione S -transferases ( GSTs ), previously known as ligandins, comprise a family of eukaryotic and prokaryotic phase II metabolic isozymes best known for their ability to catalyze the conjugation of the reduced form of glutathione (GSH) to xenobiotic substrates for the purpose of detoxification. The GST family consists of three superfamilies: the cytosolic, mitochondrial, and microsomal — also known as MAPEG — proteins.    Members of the GST superfamily are extremely diverse in amino acid sequence, and a large fraction of the sequences deposited in public databases are of unknown function.  The Enzyme Function Initiative (EFI) is using GSTs as a model superfamily to identify new GST functions. GSTs can constitute up to 10% of cytosolic protein in some mammalian organs.   GSTs catalyse the conjugation of GSH — via a sulfhydryl group — to electrophilic centers on a wide variety of substrates in order to make the compounds more water-soluble.   This activity detoxifies endogenous compounds such as peroxidised lipids and enables the breakdown of xenobiotics. GSTs may also bind toxins and function as transport proteins, which gave rise to the early term for GSTs, ligandin.  			so:0005855

Subsequently, after a structural rearrangement is catalyzed by the DExH/D-box protein Prp2, the catalytically activated spliceosome (B* complex) is formed.

1511	Calcium channel auxiliary gamma subunits	Voltage-dependent calcium channels ( VDCCs ) are a group of voltage-gated ion channels found in the membrane of excitable cells ( e.g., muscle, glial cells, neurons, etc.) with a permeability to the calcium ion Ca 2+.   These channels are slightly permeable to sodium ions, so they are also called Ca 2+ -Na + channels, but their permeability to calcium is about 1000-fold greater than to sodium under normal physiological conditions.  At physiologic or resting membrane potential, VDCCs are normally closed. They are activated ( i.e., opened) at depolarized membrane potentials and this is the source of the 'voltage-dependent' epithet. The concentration of calcium (Ca 2+ ions) is normally several thousand times higher outside of the cell than inside. Activation of particular VDCCs allows Ca 2+ to rush into the cell, which, depending on the cell type, results in activation of calcium-sensitive potassium channels, muscular contraction,  excitation of neurons, up-regulation of gene expression, or release of hormones or neurotransmitters. VDCCs have been immunolocalized in the zona glomerulosa of normal and hyperplastic human adrenal, as well as in aldosterone -producing adenomas (APA), and in the latter T-type VDCCs correlated with plasma aldosterone levels of patients.  Excessive activation of VDCCs is a major component of excitotoxicity, as severely elevated levels of intracellular calcium activates enzymes which, at high enough levels, can degrade essential cellular structures.

1582	Neurexins	Neurexin (NRXN) is a presynaptic protein that helps to connect neurons at the synapse. They are located mostly on the presynaptic membrane and contain a single transmembrane domain. The extracellular domain interacts with proteins in the synaptic cleft, most notably neuroligin, while the intracellular cytoplasmic portion interacts with proteins associated with exocytosis. Neurexin and neuroligin 'shake hands,' resulting in the connection between the two neurons and the production of a synapse. Neurexins mediate signaling across the synapse, and influence the properties of neural networks by synapse specificity. Neurexins were discovered as receptors for α-latrotoxin, a vertebrate-specific toxin in black widow spider venom that binds to presynaptic receptors and induces massive neurotransmitter release. In humans, alterations in genes encoding neurexins are implicated in autism and other cognitive diseases, such as Tourette syndrome and schizophrenia.  	NRXN		so:0005855	
1583	Neuroligins	Neuroligin (NLGN), a type I membrane protein, is a cell adhesion protein on the postsynaptic membrane that mediates the formation and maintenance of synapses between neurons. Neuroligins act as ligands for β-Neurexins, which are cell adhesion proteins located presynaptically. Neuroligin and β-neurexin 'shake hands,' resulting in the connection between two neurons and the production of a synapse. Neuroligins also affect the properties of neural networks by specifying synaptic functions, and they mediate signalling by recruiting and stabilizing key synaptic components. Neuroligins interact with other postsynaptic proteins to localize neurotransmitter receptors and channels in the postsynaptic density as the cell matures. Additionally, neuroligins are expressed in human peripheral tissues and have been found to play a role in angiogenesis. In humans, alterations in genes encoding neuroligins are implicated in autism and other cognitive disorders.	NRLGN		so:0005855

161	Ligand gated ion channels	Ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs) are a group of transmembrane ion channel proteins which open to allow ions such as Na +, K +, Ca 2+, or Cl - to pass through the membrane in response to the binding of a chemical messenger (i.e. a ligand ),  such as a neurotransmitter. These proteins are typically composed of at least two different domains: a transmembrane domain which includes the ion pore, and an extracellular domain which includes the ligand binding location (an allosteric binding site). This modularity has enabled a 'divide and conquer' approach to finding the structure of the proteins (crystallising each domain separately). The function of such receptors located at synapses is to convert the chemical signal of presynaptically released neurotransmitter directly and very quickly into a postsynaptic electrical signal. Many LGICs are additionally modulated by allosteric ligands, by channel blockers, ions, or the membrane potential. LGICs are classified into three superfamilies which lack evolutionary relationship: Cys-loop receptors, Ionotropic glutamate receptors and ATP-gated channels. 			hgnc.genegroup:294

The name was adopted after the first members of the superfamily to be studied experimentally: a group of zinc-dependent hydrolytic enzymes conferring bacterial resistance to β-lactam antibiotics.   Proteins belonging to the MBL superfamily usually combine at least one MBL domain with additional domains that provide different functions, such as substrate recognition or binding to other polypeptides, in a modular fashion. Thus, MBL superfamily members grasp the metal-assisted water-activation ability of the MBL domain in order to perform a wide variety of hydrolytic reactions. 			so:0005855

1647	Clathrin subunits	Clathrin is a protein that plays a major role in the formation of coated vesicles. Clathrin was first isolated and named by Barbara Pearse in 1976. It forms a triskelion shape composed of three clathrin heavy chains and three light chains. When the triskelia interact they form a polyhedral lattice that surrounds the vesicle. This is how clathrin gets its name, from the Latin clathratus meaning like a lattice. Coat-proteins, like clathrin, are used to build small vesicles in order to transport molecules within cells. The endocytosis and exocytosis of vesicles allows cells to communicate, to transfer nutrients, to import signaling receptors, to mediate an immune response after sampling the extracellular world, and to clean up the cell debris left by tissue inflammation. The endocytic pathway can be hijacked by viruses and other pathogens in order to gain entry to the cell during infection.			so:0005855

The viral neuraminidases are frequently used as antigenic determinants found on the surface of the influenza virus. Some variants of the influenza neuraminidase confer more virulence to the virus than others. Other homologues are found in mammalian cells, which have a range of functions.

173	Cholinergic receptors nicotinic subunits	Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, or nAChRs, are cholinergic receptors that form ligand-gated ion channels in the plasma membranes of certain neurons and on the presynaptic and postsynaptic sides of the neuromuscular junction. As ionotropic receptors, nAChRs are directly linked to ion channels and do not use second messengers (as metabotropic receptors do). Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are the best-studied of the ionotropic receptors.  Like the other type of acetylcholine receptor - muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) - nAChR is triggered by the binding of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh). Just as muscarinic receptors are named such because they are also activated by muscarine, nicotinic receptors can be opened not only by acetylcholine but also by nicotine âhence the name 'nicotinic.'   In insects, the cholinergic system is limited to the central nervous system. In contrast, neuronal receptors are found in both the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system of mammals. Mammalian neuromuscular receptors are found in the neuromuscular junctions of somatic muscles ; stimulation of these receptors causes muscular contraction.

The mature products are thought to have regulatory roles through complementarity to mRNA. miR-24 is conserved in various species, and is clustered with miR-23 and miR-27, on human chromosome 9  and 19. Recently, miR-24 has been shown to suppress expression of two crucial cell cycle control genes, E2F2 and Myc in hematopoietic differentiation and also to promote keratinocyte differentiation by repressing actin-cytoskeleton regulators PAK4, Tsk5 and ArhGAP19.

In this case the mature sequence comes from both the 3' (miR-30) and 5' (mir-97-6) arms of the precursor.

1745	General transcription factor IIH complex subunits	Transcription factor II Human (Transcription Factor II H; TFIIH) is an important protein complex, having roles in transcription of various protein-coding genes and DNA nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathways. TFIIH first came to light in 1989 when general transcription factor-δ or basic transcription factor 2 was characterized as an indispensable transcription factor in vitro. This factor was also isolated from yeast and finally named as TFIIH in 1992.TFIIH consists of ten subunits, 7 of which (ERCC2/XPD, ERCC3/XPB, GTF2H1/p62, GTF2H4/p52, GTF2H2/p44, GTF2H3/p34 and GTF2H5/TTDA) form the core complex. The cyclin activating kinase-subcomplex (CDK7, MAT1, and cyclin H) is linked to the core via the XPD protein  Two of the subunits, ERCC2/XPD and ERCC3/XPB, have helicase and ATPase activities and help create the transcription bubble.  In a test tube these subunits are only required for transcription if the DNA template is not already denatured or if it is supercoiled. Two other TFIIH subunits, CDK7 and cyclin H, phosphorylate serine amino acids on the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain and possibly other proteins involved in the cell cycle. Next to a vital function in transcription initiation, TFIIH is also involved in nucleotide excision repair.	GTF2H		hgnc.genegroup:565

Both TFIIH and TFIIE are required for promoter clearance by RNA polymerase. Transcription factor II E is encoded by the GTF2E1 and GTF2E2 genes.  TFIIE is thought to be involved in DNA melting at the promoter: it contains a zinc ribbon motif that can bind single stranded DNA.	GTF2E		hgnc.genegroup:565

Other GTFs include TFIID, a complex composed of the TATA binding protein TBP and TBP-associated factors (TAFs), as well as the factors TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH.  Together, these factors are responsible for promoter recognition and the formation of a transcription preinitiation complex (PIC) capable of initiating RNA synthesis from a DNA template.

Ion channels are considered to be one of the two traditional classes of ionophoric proteins, with the other class known as ion transporters (including the sodium-potassium pump, sodium-calcium exchanger, and sodium-glucose transport proteins, amongst others).

The single strand of RNA acts as a template for RISC to recognize complementary messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript. Once found, one of the proteins in RISC, Argonaute, activates and cleaves the mRNA. This process is called RNA interference (RNAi) and it is found in many eukaryotes; it is a key process in defense against viral infections, as it is triggered by the presence of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA).			so:0005855

Muscarinic receptors were named as such because they are more sensitive to muscarine than to nicotine. Their counterparts are nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), receptor ion channels that are also important in the autonomic nervous system.

1824	B7 family	B7 is a type of peripheral membrane protein found on activated antigen presenting cells (APC) that, when paired with either a CD28 or CD152 (CTLA-4) surface protein on a T cell, can produce a costimulatory signal or a coinhibitory signal to enhance or decrease the activity of a MHC-TCR signal between the APC and the T cell, respectively. Binding of the B7 of APC to CTLA-4 of T-cells causes inhibition of the activity of T-cells. There are two major types of B7 proteins: B7-1 or CD80, and B7-2 or CD86. However, it is not known if they differ significantly from each other. CD28 and CTLA-4 each interact with both B7-1 and B7-2.			so:0005855

1827	Profilins	Profilin is an actin-binding protein involved in the dynamic turnover and restructuring of the actin cytoskeleton.   It is found in all eukaryotic organisms in most cells. Profilin is important for spatially and temporally controlled growth of actin microfilaments, which is an essential process in cellular locomotion and cell shape changes. This restructuring of the actin cytoskeleton is essential for processes such as organ development, wound healing, and the hunting down of infectious intruders by cells of the immune system. Profilin also binds sequences rich in the amino acid proline in diverse proteins. While most profilin in the cell is bound to actin, profilins have over 50 different binding partners. Many of those are related to actin regulation, but profilin also seems to be involved in activities in the nucleus such as mRNA splicing.Profilin binds some variants of membrane phospholipids (phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate and inositol trisphosphate). The function of this interaction is the sequestration of profilin in an 'inactive' form, from where it can be released by action of the enzyme phospholipase C. Profilin is the major allergen present in birch, grass, and other pollen and is found in Toxoplasma gondii  as an essential part of host cell invasion. It is the specific pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) of TLR11.	PFN		so:0005855

These receptors have gained considerable interest in academic and pharmaceutical industry research as putative endogenous receptors for trace amines, metabolic derivatives of classical biogenic amines and the psychostimulants amphetamine and methamphetamine.    In 2004 it was shown that in mammals TAAR1 is probably also a receptor for thyronamines, decarboxylated and deiodinated metabolites of the thyroid hormones, while the mouse mTAAR2 - mTAAR9 receptors are most probably olfactory receptors for volatile amines.

1880	Runt-related transcription factors	Runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) also known as acute myeloid leukemia 1 protein (AML1) or core-binding factor subunit alpha-2 (CBFA2) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the RUNX1 gene. RUNX1 is a transcription factor that regulates the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells into mature blood cells.  In addition it plays a major role in the development of the neurons that  transmit pain. It belongs to the Runt-related transcription factor (RUNX) family of genes which are also called core binding factor-α (CBFα). RUNX proteins form a heterodimeric complex with CBFβ which confers increased DNA binding and stability to the complex. Chromosomal translocations involving the RUNX1 gene are associated with several types of leukemia including M2 AML. Mutations in RUNX1 are implicated in cases of breast cancer.	RUNX		so:0005855

189	Chemokine receptors	Chemokine receptors are cytokine receptors found on the surface of certain cells that interact with a type of cytokine called a chemokine.  There have been 19 distinct chemokine receptors described in mammals. Each has a 7- transmembrane (7TM) structure and couples to G-protein for signal transduction within a cell, making them members of a large protein family of G protein-coupled receptors. Following interaction with their specific chemokine ligands, chemokine receptors trigger a flux in intracellular calcium (Ca 2+ ) ions ( calcium signaling ). This causes cell responses, including the onset of a process known as chemotaxis that traffics the cell to a desired location within the organism. Chemokine receptors are divided into different families, CXC chemokine receptors, CC chemokine receptors, CX3C chemokine receptors and XC chemokine receptors that correspond to the 4 distinct subfamilies of chemokines they bind.			hgnc.genegroup:140

1903	Aldolases	Aldolase A (ALDOA, or ALDA), also known as fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the ALDOA gene on chromosome 16. The protein encoded by this gene is a glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes the reversible conversion of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP). Three aldolase isozymes (A, B, and C), encoded by three different genes, are differentially expressed during development. Aldolase A is found in the developing embryo and is produced in even greater amounts in adult muscle. Aldolase A expression is repressed in adult liver, kidney and intestine and similar to aldolase C levels in brain and other nervous tissue. Aldolase A deficiency has been associated with myopathy and hemolytic anemia. Alternative splicing and alternative promoter usage results in multiple transcript variants. Related pseudogenes have been identified on chromosomes 3 and 10. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2011]	ALDO		so:0005855

1926	Isocitrate dehydrogenases	Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) (EC 1.1.1.42) and (EC 1.1.1.41) is an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate, producing alpha-ketoglutarate (α-ketoglutarate) and CO2. This is a two-step process, which involves oxidation of isocitrate (a secondary alcohol) to oxalosuccinate (a ketone), followed by the decarboxylation of the carboxyl group beta to the ketone, forming alpha-ketoglutarate. In humans, IDH exists in three isoforms: IDH3 catalyzes the third step of the citric acid cycle while converting NAD+ to NADH in the mitochondria. The isoforms IDH1 and IDH2 catalyze the same reaction outside the context of the citric acid cycle and use NADP+ as a cofactor instead of NAD+. They localize to the cytosol as well as the mitochondrion and peroxisome.	IDH		so:0005855	
1927	Pepsinogens	Pepsin is an endopeptidase that breaks down proteins into smaller peptides (that is, a protease). It is produced in the stomach and is one of the main digestive enzymes in the digestive systems of humans and many other animals, where it helps digest the proteins in food. Pepsin is an aspartic protease, using a catalytic aspartate in its active site.It is one of three principal proteases in the human digestive system, the other two being chymotrypsin and trypsin. During the process of digestion, these enzymes, each of which is specialized in severing links between particular types of amino acids, collaborate to break down dietary proteins into their components, i.e., peptides and amino acids, which can be readily absorbed by the small intestine. Pepsin is most efficient in cleaving peptide bonds between hydrophobic and preferably aromatic amino acids such as phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine. Pepsin's proenzyme, pepsinogen, is released by the chief cells in the stomach wall, and upon mixing with the hydrochloric acid of the gastric juice, pepsinogen activates to become pepsin.  			hgnc.genegroup:1928	
1928	Peptidase family A1	Aspartic proteases are a catalytic type of protease enzymes that use an activated water molecule bound to one or more aspartate residues for catalysis of their peptide substrates. In general, they have two highly conserved aspartates in the active site and are optimally active at acidic pH. Nearly all known aspartyl proteases are inhibited by pepstatin.Aspartic endopeptidases EC 3.4.23. of vertebrate, fungal and retroviral origin have been characterised. More recently, aspartic endopeptidases associated with the processing of bacterial type 4 prepilin and archaean preflagellin have been described.Eukaryotic aspartic proteases include pepsins, cathepsins, and renins. They have a two-domain structure, arising from ancestral duplication. Retroviral and retrotransposon proteases (retroviral aspartyl proteases) are much smaller and appear to be homologous to a single domain of the eukaryotic aspartyl proteases. Each domain contributes a catalytic Asp residue, with an extended active site cleft localized between the two lobes of the molecule. One lobe has probably evolved from the other through a gene duplication event in the distant past. In modern-day enzymes, although the three-dimensional structures are very similar, the amino acid sequences are more divergent, except for the catalytic site motif, which is very conserved. The presence and position of disulfide bridges are other conserved features of aspartic peptidases.			so:0005855

Its metazoan counterpart NRZ complex, which comprises NAG, RINT1, and ZW10, is also involved in Golgi-to-ER retrograde transport, but each component of the complex has diverse cellular functions including endosome-to-Golgi transport, cytokinesis, cell cycle checkpoint, autophagy, and mRNA decay. 			so:0005855

Histone proteins are highly post-translationally modified however Histone H3 is the most extensively modified of the five histones. The term 'Histone H3' alone is purposely ambiguous in that it does not distinguish between sequence variants or modification state. Histone H3 is an important protein in the emerging field of epigenetics, where its sequence variants and variable modification states are thought to play a role in the dynamic and long term regulation of genes.

Histone proteins are highly post-translationally modified. Covalently bonded modifications include acetylation and methylation of the N-terminal tails. These modifications may alter expression of genes located on DNA associated with its parent histone octamer.

1950	Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins	Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) are complexes of RNA and protein present in the cell nucleus during gene transcription and subsequent post-transcriptional modification of the newly synthesized RNA (pre-mRNA). The presence of the proteins bound to a pre-mRNA molecule serves as a signal that the pre-mRNA is not yet fully processed and therefore not ready for export to the cytoplasm. Since most mature RNA is exported from the nucleus relatively quickly, most RNA-binding protein in the nucleus exist as heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein particles. After splicing has occurred, the proteins remain bound to spliced introns and target them for degradation. hnRNPs are also integral to the 40s subunit of the ribosome and therefore important for the translation of mRNA in the cytoplasm. However, hnRNPs also have their own nuclear localization sequences (NLS) and are therefore found mainly in the nucleus. Though it is known that a few hnRNPs shuttle between the cytoplasm and nucleus, immunofluorescence microscopy with hnRNP-specific antibodies shows nucleoplasmic localization of these proteins with little staining in the nucleolus or cytoplasm. This is likely because of its major role in binding to newly transcribed RNAs. High-resolution immunoelectron microscopy has shown that hnRNPs localize predominantly to the border regions of chromatin, where it has access to these nascent RNAs.The proteins involved in the hnRNP complexes are collectively known as heterogeneous ribonucleoproteins. They include protein K and polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB), which is regulated by phosphorylation catalyzed by protein kinase A and is responsible for suppressing RNA splicing at a particular exon by blocking access of the spliceosome to the polypyrimidine tract. hnRNPs are also responsible for strengthening and inhibiting splice sites by making such sites more or less accessible to the spliceosome.  Cooperative interactions between attached hnRNPs may encourage certain splicing combinations while inhibiting others.	HNRNP		so:0005855

These receptors were originally identified by their ability to bind N-formyl peptides such as N -formylmethionine produced by the degradation of either bacterial or host cells.  Hence formyl peptide receptors are involved in mediating immune cell response to infection. These receptors may also act to suppress the immune system under certain conditions.

KASH domains interact with proteins containing SUN domains in the space between the outer and inner nuclear membranes to bridge the nuclear envelope, and may transfer force from the nucleoskeleton to the cytoplasmic cytoskeleton and enable mechanosensory roles in cells.  KASH proteins are thought to largely localize to the outer nuclear membrane, although there are reports of inner nuclear membrane localization of some KASH protein isoforms.			hgnc.genegroup:2005

202	Cannabinoid receptors	The cannabinoid receptors are a class of cell membrane receptors under the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily.   As is typical of G protein-coupled receptors, the cannabinoid receptors contain seven transmembrane spanning domains.  Cannabinoid receptors are activated by three major groups of ligands, endocannabinoids (produced by the mammalian body), plant cannabinoids (such as THC, produced by the cannabis plant) and synthetic cannabinoids (such as HU-210 ). All of the endocannabinoids and plant cannabinoids are lipophilic, i.e. fat soluble, compounds. There are currently two known subtypes, termed CB 1 and CB 2.  The CB 1 receptor is expressed mainly in the brain ( central nervous system or 'CNS'), but also in the lungs, liver and kidneys. The CB 2 receptor is expressed mainly in the immune system and in hematopoietic cells. Mounting evidence suggests that there are novel cannabinoid receptors  that is, non-CB 1 and non-CB 2, which are expressed in endothelial cells and in the CNS. In 2007, the binding of several cannabinoids to a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) in the brain was described.  The protein sequences of CB 1 and CB 2 receptors are about 44% similar.  When only the transmembrane regions of the receptors are considered, amino acid similarity between the two receptor subtypes is approximately 68%.  In addition, minor variations in each receptor have been identified. Cannabinoids bind reversibly and stereo-selectively to the cannabinoid receptors. Subtype selective cannabinoids have been developed which theoretically may have advantages for treatment of certain diseases such as obesity.	CNR		hgnc.genegroup:201

Most metalloproteases require zinc, but some use cobalt. The metal ion is coordinated to the protein via three ligands. The ligands coordinating the metal ion can vary with histidine, glutamate, aspartate, lysine, and arginine. The fourth coordination position is taken up by a labile water molecule. Treatment with chelating agents such as EDTA leads to complete inactivation. EDTA is a metal chelator that removes zinc, which is essential for activity.

212	Purinergic receptors	Purinergic receptors, also known as purinoceptors, are a family of plasma membrane molecules that are found in almost all mammalian tissues.  Broadly, purinergic receptors and signaling have been implicated in learning and memory, locomotor and feeding behavior, and sleep.  More specifically, these receptors are involved in several cellular functions, including proliferation and migration of neural stem cells, vascular reactivity, apoptosis and cytokine secretion.  These functions have not been well characterized and the effect of the extracellular microenvironment on their function is also poorly understood. The term purinergic receptor was originally introduced to illustrate specific classes of membrane receptors that mediate relaxation of gut smooth muscle as a response to the release of ATP (P2 receptors) or adenosine (P1 receptors). P2 receptors have further been divided into five subclasses: P2X, P2Y, P2Z, P2U, and P2T. To distinguish P2 receptors further, the subclasses have been divided into families of metabotropic (P2Y, P2U, and P2T) and ionotropic receptors (P2X and P2Z).	P2R		so:0005855

2258	Flavoproteins	Flavoproteins are proteins that contain a nucleic acid derivative of riboflavin. These proteins are involved in a wide array of biological processes, including removal of radicals contributing to oxidative stress, photosynthesis, and DNA repair. The flavoproteins are some of the most-studied families of enzymes. Flavoproteins have either FMN (flavin mononucleotide) or FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide) as a prosthetic group or as a cofactor. The flavin is generally tightly bound (as in adrenodoxin reductase, wherein the FAD is buried deeply). About 5-10% of flavoproteins have a covalently linked FAD. Based on the available structural data, FAD-binding sites can be divided into more than 200 different types.90 flavoproteins are encoded in the human genome; about 84% require FAD and around 16% require FMN, whereas 5 proteins require both. Flavoproteins are mainly located in the mitochondria. Of all flavoproteins, 90% perform redox reactions and the other 10% are transferases, lyases, isomerases, ligases.			so:0005855

226	Galanin receptors	The galanin receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor, or metabotropic receptor which binds galanin. Galanin receptors can be found throughout the peripheral and central nervous systems and the endocrine system. So far three subtypes are known to exist: GAL-R1, GAL-R2, and GAL-R3. The specific function of each subtype remains to be fully elucidated, although as of 2009 great progress is currently being made in this respect with the generation of receptor subtype-specific knockout mice,  and the first selective ligands for galanin receptor subtypes. Selective galanin agonists are anticonvulsant,  while antagonists produce antidepressant and anxiolytic effects in animals,   so either agonist or antagonist ligands for the galanin receptors may be potentially therapeutic compounds in humans.

227	Gonadotropin releasing hormone receptors	The gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GNRHR), also known as the luteinizing hormone releasing hormone receptor ( LHRHR ), is a member of the seven-transmembrane, G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) family. It is expressed on the surface of pituitary gonadotrope cells as well as lymphocytes, breast, ovary, and prostate. This receptor is a 60 kDa G protein-coupled receptor and resides primarily in the pituitary and is responsible for eliciting the actions of LHRH after its release from the hypothalamus. Upon activation, the LHRHr stimulates tyrosine phosphatase and elicits the release of LH from the pituitary. Evidence exists showing the presence of LHRH and its receptor in extrapituitary tissues as well as a role in progression of some cancers.	GNRHR		hgnc.genegroup:220

When they bind to Notch receptors this induces a conformational change (regulated intramembrane proteolysis) in the receptor, freeing its Notch intracellular domain (NICD). The NICD can then translocate to the nucleus and promote gene transcription.  			so:0005855

2280	DREAM complex subunits	The dimerization partner, RB-like, E2F and multi-vulval class B (DREAM) complex is a protein complex responsible for the regulation of cell cycle-dependent gene expression. The complex is evolutionarily conserved, although some of its components vary from species to species. In humans, the key proteins in the complex are RBL1 (p107) and RBL2 (p130), both of which are homologs of RB (p105) and bind repressive E2F transcription factors E2F4 and E2F5; DP1, DP2 and DP3, dimerization partners of E2F; and MuvB, which is a complex of LIN9/37/52/54 and RBBP4.			so:0005855	
2281	MuvB complex subunits	MuvB complexes are key to regulating the cell-division cycle. The MuvB complex can form part of the transcriptional repressor complex DREAM, or part of the activator complexes MMB and FOXM1-MuvB.  When cells are not actively dividing, the DREAM complex represses G1/S and G2/M genes. The expression of mitotic genes in the G2/M stage of the cell cycle can be regulated by MuvB activator complexes which include either the oncogenic transcription factor B-MYB or FOXM1.			hgnc.genegroup:2280|hgnc.genegroup:2282|hgnc.genegroup:2283

236	Melanocortin receptors	Melanocortin receptors are members of the rhodopsin family of 7-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors. There are five known members of the melanocortin receptor system  each with differing specificities for melanocortins :   MC1R. MC1R is associated with pigmentation genetics. MC2R. MC2R is also known as the ACTH receptor or corticotropin receptor because it is specific for ACTH alone. MC3R. MC3R MC4R. Defects in MC4R are a cause of autosomal dominant obesity, accounting for 6% of all cases of early-onset obesity.  MC5R. MC5R  These receptors are inhibited by endogenous inverse agonists agouti signalling peptide and agouti-related peptide, and activated by synthetic (i.e. afamelanotide ) and endogenous agonist melanocyte-stimulating hormones.			hgnc.genegroup:220	
239	Neuromedin U receptors	The neuromedin U receptors are two G-protein coupled receptors which bind the neuropeptide hormones neuromedin U and neuromedin S. There are two subtypes of the neuromedin U receptor, each encoded by a separate gene ( NMUR1, NMUR2 ).	NMUR		hgnc.genegroup:220	
24	Cadherin related	The cadherin-related (CDHR) genes do not fit into the major cadherin or protocadherin families as they are phylogenetically clearly separated. The encoded proteins comprise at least two typical, consecutive cadherin motifs, but often more than the typical members of the cadherin and protocadherin families. Their overall domain organization differs from the members of the major cadherin family and the protocadherin family, and includes different and unique cytoplasmic domains.	CDHR		hgnc.genegroup:16	
240	Neuropeptide FF receptors	The neuropeptide FF receptors are members of the G-protein coupled receptor superfamily of integral membrane proteins which bind the pain modulatory neuropeptides AF and FF. The Neuropeptide FF receptor family is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily containing two subtypes, NPFF1 and NPFF2, which exhibit a high affinity for Neuropeptide FF (NPFF) peptides. NPFF1 is broadly distributed in the central nervous system with the highest levels found in the limbic system and the hypothalamus. NPFF2 is present in high density, particularly in mammals in the superficial layers of the spinal cord where it is involved in nociception and modulation of opioid functions These receptors participate to the modulation of opioid receptor function in the brain and spinal cord, and can either reduce or increase opioid receptor function depending which tissue they are released in, reflecting a complex role for neuropeptide FF in pain responses. 	NPFFR		hgnc.genegroup:220	
241	Neuropeptide S receptor	The neuropeptide S receptor ( NPSR ) is a member of the G-protein coupled receptor superfamily of integral membrane proteins  which binds neuropeptide S (NPS).  It was formerly an orphan receptor, GPR154, until the discovery of neuropeptide S as the endogenous ligand. In the CNS, activation of the NPSR by NPS promotes arousal and anxiolytic -like effects.  In addition, mututations in NPSR have been linked to a susceptibility to asthma. Hence NPSR has also been called GPRA (G protein-coupled receptor for asthma susceptibility). Activation of NPSR in the airway epithelium has a number of effects including upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases which are involved in the pathogenesis of asthma.  This gene is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor 1 family and encodes a plasma membrane protein. Increased expression of this gene in ciliated cells of the respiratory epithelium and in bronchial smooth muscle cells is associated with asthma. Mutations in this gene have also been associated with this disease. Alternatively spliced variants which encode different protein isoforms have been described; however, not all variants have been fully characterized.	NPSR		hgnc.genegroup:220

243	Neuropeptide Y receptors	Neuropeptide Y receptors are a class of G-protein coupled receptors which are activated by the closely related peptide hormones neuropeptide Y, peptide YY and pancreatic polypeptide. These receptors are involved in the control of a diverse set of behavioral processes including appetite, circadian rhythm, and anxiety.    Activated neuropeptide receptors release the G i subunit from the heterotrimeric G protein complex. The G i subunit in turn inhibits the production of the second messenger cAMP from ATP.			hgnc.genegroup:220

245	Opioid receptors	Opioid receptors are a group of G protein-coupled receptors with opioids as ligands.  The endogenous opioids are dynorphins, enkephalins, endorphins, endomorphins and nociceptin. The opioid receptors are ~40% identical to somatostatin receptors (SSTRs). Opiate receptors are distributed widely in the brain, and are found in the spinal cord and digestive tract.	OPR		hgnc.genegroup:220	
247	Two pore segment channels	This small family of 2 members putatively forms cation-selective ion channels. They are predicted to contain two KV-style six-transmembrane domains, suggesting they form a dimer in the membrane. These channels are closely related to CatSper channels and, more distantly, to TRP channels.	TPCN		hgnc.genegroup:178|hgnc.genegroup:182	
249	Transient receptor potential cation channels	Transient receptor potential channels (TRP channels) are a group of ion channels located mostly on the plasma membrane of numerous human and animal cell types. There are about 28 TRP channels that share some structural similarity to each other.  These are grouped into two broad groups: Group 1 includes TRPC ( 'C' for canonical), TRPV ('V' for vanilloid), TRPM ('M' for melastatin), TRPN, and TRPA. In group 2, there are TRPP ('P' for polycystic) and TRPML ('ML' for mucolipin). Many of these channels mediate a variety of sensations like the sensations of pain, hotness, warmth or coldness, different kinds of tastes, pressure, and vision. In the body, some TRP channels are thought to behave like microscopic thermometers and used in animals to sense hot or cold. Some TRP channels are activated by molecules found in spices like garlic ( allicin ), chilli pepper ( capsaicin ), wasabi ( allyl isothiocyanate ); others are activated by menthol, camphor, peppermint, and cooling agents; yet others are activated by molecules found in cannabis (i.e., THC, CBD and CBN ). Some act as sensors of osmotic pressure, volume, stretch, and vibration. These ion channels are relatively non-selectively permeable to cations, including sodium, calcium and magnesium. TRP channels were initially discovered in trp -mutant strain of the fruit fly Drosophila. Later, TRP channels were found in vertebrates where they are ubiquitously expressed in many cell types and tissues. Most TRP channels are composed of 6 membrane -spanning helices with intracellular N- and C-termini. Mammalian TRP channels are activated and regulated by a wide variety of stimuli and are expressed throughout the body.	TRP		hgnc.genegroup:178	
250	Cyclic nucleotide gated channels	Cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels or CNG channels are ion channels that function in response to the binding of cyclic nucleotides. CNG channels are nonselective cation channels that are found in the membranes of various tissue and cell types, and are significant in sensory transduction as well as cellular development. Their function can be the result of a combination of the binding of cyclic nucleotides (cGMP and cAMP) and either a depolarization or a hyperpolarization event. Initially discovered in the cells that make up the retina of the eye, CNG channels have been found in many different cell types across both the animal and the plant kingdoms. CNG channels have a very complex structure with various subunits and domains that play a critical role in their function. CNG channels are significant in the function of various sensory pathways including vision and olfaction, as well as in other key cellular functions such as hormone release and chemotaxis.	CNG		hgnc.genegroup:178	
253	Calcium voltage-gated channel subunits	Voltage-dependent calcium channels ( VDCC ) are a group of voltage-gated ion channels found in the membrane of excitable cells ( e.g., muscle, glial cells, neurons, etc.) with a permeability to the calcium ion Ca 2+.  These channels are slightly permeable to sodium ions, so they are also called Ca 2+ -Na + channels, but their permeability to calcium is about 1000-fold greater than to sodium under normal physiological conditions.  At physiologic or resting membrane potential, VDCCs are normally closed. They are activated ( i.e., opened) at depolarized membrane potentials and this is the source of the 'voltage-dependent' epithet. The concentration of calcium (Ca 2+ ions) is normally several thousand times higher outside of the cell than inside. Activation of particular VDCCs allows Ca 2+ to rush into the cell, which, depending on the cell type, results in activation of calcium-sensitive potassium channels, muscular contraction, excitation of neurons, up-regulation of gene expression, or release of hormones or neurotransmitters. Excessive activation of VDCCs is a major component of excitotoxicity, as severely elevated levels of intracellular calcium activates enzymes which, at high enough levels, can degrade essential cellular structures.

259	Arginine vasopressin and oxytocin receptors	The actions of vasopressin are mediated by stimulation of tissue-specific G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) called vasopressin receptors that are classified into V1, V2 and V3 subtypes.  These three subtypes differ in localization, function and signal transduction mechanisms. 	AVPR		hgnc.genegroup:220	
26	Zinc fingers	A zinc finger is a small protein structural motif that is characterized by the coordination of one or more zinc ions in order to stabilize the fold. Originally coined to describe the finger-like appearance of a hypothesized structure from Xenopus laevis transcription factor IIIA, the zinc finger name has now come to encompass a wide variety of differing protein structures.  Proteins that contain zinc fingers ( zinc finger proteins ) are classified into several different structural families. Unlike many other clearly defined supersecondary structures such as Greek keys or beta hairpins, there are a number of unique types of zinc fingers, each with a unique three-dimensional architecture. A particular zinc finger protein's class is determined by this three-dimensional structure, but it can also be recognized based on the primary structure of the protein or the identity of the ligands coordinating the zinc ion. In spite of the large variety of these proteins, however, the vast majority typically function as interaction modules that bind DNA, RNA, proteins, or other small, useful molecules, and variations in structure serve primarily to alter the binding specificity of a particular protein. Since their original discovery and the elucidation of their structure, these interaction modules have proven ubiquitous in the biological world. In addition, zinc fingers have become extremely useful in various therapeutic and research capacities. Engineering zinc fingers to have an affinity for a specific sequence is an area of active research, and zinc finger nucleases and zinc finger transcription factors are two of the most important applications of this to be realized to date.			so:0005855

265	Calcitonin receptors	The calcitonin receptor (CT) is a G protein-coupled receptor that binds the peptide hormone calcitonin and is involved in maintenance of calcium homeostasis, particularly with respect to bone formation and metabolism.   CT works by activating the G-proteins G s and G q often found on osteoclasts, on cells in the kidney, and on cells in a number of regions of the brain.  It may also affect the ovaries in women and the testes in men. The function of the CT receptor protein is modified through its interaction with Receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs), forming the multimeric amylin receptors AMY 1 (CT + RAMP1), AMY 2 (CT + RAMP2), and AMY 3 (CT+ RAMP3).

270	Parathyroid hormone receptors	There are two known parathyroid hormone receptors in mammals termed PTH1R and PTH2R. These receptors bind parathyroid hormone and are members of the GPCR family of transmembrane proteins.  parathyroid hormone 1 receptor (PTH1R) is the classical PTH receptor, is expressed in high levels in bone and kidney and regulates calcium ion homeostasis through activation of adenylate cyclase and phospholipase C.    parathyroid hormone 2 receptor (PTH2R) is expressed primarily in the central nervous system, pancreas, testis, and placenta.			hgnc.genegroup:263	
274	Potassium voltage-gated channels	Voltage-gated potassium channels are transmembrane channels specific for potassium and sensitive to voltage changes in the cell's membrane potential. During action potentials, they play a crucial role in returning the depolarized cell to a resting state.			hgnc.genegroup:178|hgnc.genegroup:183	
275	G protein-coupled receptors, Class C metabotropic glutamate/pheromone	The class C G-protein-coupled receptors (IPR000337) are a class of G-protein coupled receptors that include the metabotropic glutamate receptors (IPR000162) and several additional receptors.  Family C GPCRs have a large extracellular N-terminus which binds the orthosteric (endogenous) ligand. The shape of this domain is often likened to a clam. Several allosteric ligands to these receptors have been identified and these bind within the seven transmembrane region.			hgnc.genegroup:139	
276	Potassium inwardly rectifying channel subfamily J	Inwardly rectifying potassium channels ( Kir, IRK ) are a specific subset of potassium selective ion channels. To date, seven subfamilies have been identified in various mammalian cell types  and they are also found in plants.  They are the targets of multiple toxins, and malfunction of the channels has been implicated in several diseases.	KCNJ		hgnc.genegroup:183	
277	Potassium two pore domain channel subfamily K 	The two-pore-domain potassium channel a family of 15 members form what is known as 'leak channels' which possess Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (open) rectification. These channels are regulated by several mechanisms including oxygen tension, pH, mechanical stretch, and G-proteins.  Their name is derived from the fact that the alpha subunits consist of four transmembrane segments, each containing two pore loops. As such, they structurally correspond to two inward-rectifier alpha subunits and thus form dimers in the membrane.	KCNK		hgnc.genegroup:178|hgnc.genegroup:183	
278	Chloride channels	Chloride channels are a superfamily of poorly understood ion channels consisting of approximately 13 members. Chloride channels display a variety of important physiological and cellular roles that include regulation of pH, volume homeostasis, organic solute transport, cell migration, cell proliferation and differentiation. Based on sequence homology the chloride channels can be subdivided into a number of groups. The importance of one such group, the CLC family of chloride channels, can be seen from the diseases that develop when the channel does not function normally. This family of ion channels contains 10 or 12 transmembrane helices. Each protein forms a single pore. It has been shown that some members of this family form homodimers. In terms of primary structure, they are unrelated to known cation channels or other types of anion channels. Three CLC subfamilies are found in animals. CLC-1 ( P35523 ) is involved in setting and restoring the resting membrane potential of skeletal muscle, while other channels play important parts in solute concentration mechanisms in the kidney. These proteins contain two CBS domains. Chloride channels are also important for maintaining safe ion concentrations within plant cells.			hgnc.genegroup:292	
279	Calcium sensing receptors	The calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a Class C G-protein coupled receptor which senses extracellular levels of calcium ion. In the parathyroid gland, the calcium-sensing receptor controls calcium homeostasis by regulating the release of parathyroid hormone (PTH).			hgnc.genegroup:275	
28	Zinc fingers C2H2-type	The Cys2His2-like fold group is by far the best-characterized class of zinc fingers and are extremely common in mammalian transcription factors.

280	Gamma-aminobutyric acid type B receptor subunits	GABA B receptors (GABA BR) are metabotropic transmembrane receptors for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) that are linked via G-proteins to potassium channels.  The changing potassium concentrations hyperpolarize the cell at the end of an action potential. The reversal potential the GABA B-mediated IPSP is -100 mV, which is much more hyperpolarized than the GABA A IPSP. GABA B receptors are found in the central and peripheral autonomic nervous system.	GABBR		hgnc.genegroup:275|hgnc.genegroup:562	
281	Glutamate metabotropic receptors	The metabotropic glutamate receptors, or mGluR s, are a type of glutamate receptor that are active through an indirect metabotropic process. They are members of the group C family of G-protein-coupled receptors, or GPCRs.  Like all glutamate receptors, mGluRs bind with glutamate, an amino acid that functions as an excitatory neurotransmitter.	GRM		hgnc.genegroup:275|hgnc.genegroup:282	
282	Glutamate receptors	Glutamate receptors are synaptic receptors located primarily on the membranes of neuronal cells. Glutamate (glutamic acid) is abundant in the human body, but particularly in the nervous system and especially prominent in the human brain where it is the body's most prominent neurotransmitter, the brain's main excitatory neurotransmitter, and also the precursor for GABA, the brain's main inhibitory neurotransmitter.  Glutamate receptors are responsible for the glutamate-mediated postsynaptic excitation of neural cells, and are important for neural communication, memory formation, learning, and regulation. Glutamate receptors are implicated in a number of neurological conditions. Their central role in excitotoxicity and prevalence in the central nervous system has been linked or speculated to be linked to many neurodegenerative diseases, and several other conditions have been further linked to glutamate receptor gene mutations or receptor autoantigen /antibody activity.			so:0005855

284	Glutamate ionotropic receptors	The ability of synapses to modify their synaptic strength in response to activity is a fundamental property of the nervous system and may be an essential component of learning and memory. There are four classes of ionotropic glutamate receptors, namely NMDA receptor, AMPA receptor, Delta receptor and kainate receptors. They are believed to play critical roles in synaptic plasticity. At many synapses in the brain, transient activation of NMDA receptors leads to a persistent modification in the strength of synaptic transmission mediated by AMPA receptors and kainate receptors can act as the induction trigger for long-term changes in synaptic transmission.

287	Ryanodine receptors	Ryanodine receptors ( RyRs ) form a class of intracellular calcium channels in various forms of excitable animal tissue like muscles and neurons. It is the major cellular mediator of calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) in animal cells.	RYR		hgnc.genegroup:182|hgnc.genegroup:161	
288	Pannexins	Pannexins (from Greek 'pan' all, and from Latin 'nexus' connection) are a family of vertebrate proteins identified by their homology to the invertebrate innexins. While innexins are responsible for forming gap junctions in invertebrates, the pannexins have been shown to predominantly exist as large transmembrane channels connecting the intracellular and extracellular space, allowing the passage of ions and small molecules between these compartments (such as ATP and sulforhodamine B). 	PANX		hgnc.genegroup:1471	
289	Taste receptors	A taste receptor is a type of receptor which facilitates the sensation of taste. When food or other substances enter the mouth, molecules interact with saliva and are bound to taste receptors in the oral cavity and other locations. Molecules which give a sensation of taste are considered 'sapid'.			hgnc.genegroup:139	
290	Acid sensing ion channel subunits	Acid-Sensing Ion Channels (ASICs) are neuronal voltage-insensitive cationic channels activated by extracellular protons. ASIC proteins are a subfamily of the ENaC/Deg superfamily of ion channels. To date five proteins of the ASIC family have been identified that arise from four genes, ASIC1, ASIC2, ASIC3, and ASIC4. ASIC1a, 1b and 2a, 2b are splice variants. ASICs are trimeric and can be made up of different combinations of subunits. ASIC2b is non functional on its own but modulates channel activity when participating in heteromultimers. ASIC4 has no known function. All ASICs are expressed in the peripheral nervous system while ASIC1a, 2a, 2b and 4 are expressed in the central nervous system. ASICs are Na+ permeable with ASIC1a showing low Ca++ permeability.	ASIC		hgnc.genegroup:179|hgnc.genegroup:294	
291	Vomeronasal receptors	Pheromones have evolved in all animal phyla, to signal sex and dominance status, and are responsible for stereotypical social and sexual behaviour among members of the same species. In mammals, these chemical signals are believed to be detected primarily by the vomeronasal organ (VNO), a chemosensory organ located at the base of the nasal septum.  The VNO is present in most amphibia, reptiles and non-primate mammals but is absent in birds, adult catarrhine monkeys and apes. An active role for the human VNO in the detection of pheromones is disputed; the VNO is clearly present in the fetus but appears to be atrophied or absent in adults. Three distinct families of putative pheromone receptors have been identified in the vomeronasal organ (V1Rs, V2Rs and V3Rs). All are G protein-coupled receptors but are only distantly related to the receptors of the main olfactory system, highlighting their different role.  The V1 receptors share between 50 and 90% sequence identity but have little similarity to other families of G protein-coupled receptors. They appear to be distantly related to the mammalian T2R bitter taste receptors and the rhodopsin-like GPCRs. A number of human V1 receptor homologues have also been found. The majority of these human sequences are pseudogenes but an apparently functional receptor has been identified that is expressed in the human olfactory system.	VN1R, VN2R		hgnc.genegroup:139

293	Adiponectin receptors	Similar to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), ADIPOR1 also possesses 7 transmembrane domains. However ADIPOR1 is orientated oppositely to GPCRs in the membrane (i.e., cytoplasmic N-terminus, extracellular C-terminus) and does not associate with G proteins.	ADIPOR		so:0005855	
294	Ion channels by gating mechanism				hgnc.genegroup:177	
297	Inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors	Inositol trisphosphate receptor ( InsP3R ) is a membrane glycoprotein complex acting as a Ca 2+ channel activated by inositol trisphosphate (InsP3). InsP3R is very diverse among organisms, and is necessary for the control of cellular and physiological processes including cell division, cell proliferation, apoptosis, fertilization, development, behavior, learning and memory.  Inositol triphosphate receptor represents a dominant second messenger leading to the release of Ca 2+ from intracellular store sites. There is strong evidence suggesting that the InsP3R plays an important role in the conversion of external stimuli to intracellular Ca 2+ signals characterized by complex patterns relative to both space and time. For example, Ca 2+ waves and oscillations.  The InsP3 receptor was first purified from rat cerebellum by neuroscientists Surachai Supattapone and Solomon Snyder at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.

This pore allows the passage of ions and numerous other, non-specific molecules through the membrane. Found in the mitochondrial and plastid outer membrane of eukaryotes, in many Gram-negative bacteria, at least some Corynebacterineae, archaea and in sea anemones.			hgnc.genegroup:292	
305	Aquaporins	Aquaporins are integral membrane proteins from a larger family of major intrinsic proteins (MIP) that form pores in the membrane of biological cells. Genetic defects involving aquaporin genes have been associated with several human diseases.  The 2003 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded jointly to Peter Agre for the discovery of aquaporins,  and Roderick MacKinnon for his work on the structure and mechanism of potassium channels. The plasma membranes of a variety of different animal and plant cells contain aquaporins through which water can flow more rapidly inside the cell than by diffusing through the phospholipid bilayer.	AQP		hgnc.genegroup:304	
306	Voltage dependent anion channels	Voltage-dependent anion channels are a class of porin ion channel located on the outer mitochondrial membrane. There is debate as to whether or not this channel is expressed in the cell surface membrane.    This major protein of the outer mitochondrial membrane of eukaryotes forms a voltage-dependent anion-selective channel (VDAC) that behaves as a general diffusion pore for small hydrophilic molecules.   The channel adopts an open conformation at low or zero membrane potential and a closed conformation at potentials above 30-40 mV. VDAC facilitates the exchange of ions and molecules between mitochondria and cytosol and is regulated by the interactions with other proteins and small molecules.	VDAC		hgnc.genegroup:304

314	Gap junction proteins	Connexins, or gap junction proteins, are a family of structurally related transmembrane proteins that assemble to form vertebrate gap junctions (an entirely different family of proteins, the innexins, form gap junctions in invertebrates).  Each gap junction is composed of two hemichannels, or connexons, which are themselves each constructed out of six connexin molecules. Gap junctions are essential for many physiological processes, such as the coordinated depolarization of cardiac muscle, proper embryonic development, and the conducted response in microvasculature. For this reason, mutations in connexin-encoding genes can lead to functional and developmental abnormalities.	GJ		hgnc.genegroup:292|hgnc.genegroup:1471	
320	Receptor kinases				so:0005855	
321	Receptor tyrosine kinases	Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), a family of cell-surface receptors, which transduce signals to polypeptide and protein hormones, cytokines and growth factors are key regulators of critical cellular processes, such as proliferation and differentiation, cell survival and metabolism, cell migration and cell cycle control. In the human genome, 58 RTKs have been identified, which fall into 20 families. All RTKs display an extracellular ligand binding domain, a single transmembrane helix, a cytoplasmic region containing the protein tyrosine kinase activity (occasionally split into two domains by an insertion, termed the kinase insertion), with juxta-membrane and C-terminal regulatory regions. Agonist binding to the extracellular domain evokes dimerization, and sometimes oligomerization, of RTKs (a small subset of RTKs forms multimers even in the absence of activating ligand). This leads to autophosphorylation in the tyrosine kinase domain in a trans orientation, serving as a site of assembly of protein complexes and stimulation of multiple signal transduction pathways, including phospholipase C-γ, mitogen-activated protein kinases and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.			hgnc.genegroup:320

348	Immunoglobulins	Immunoglobulins (IG) or antibodies are antigen receptors of the B cells of the adaptive immune response, acquired by jawed vertebrates (or gnathostomata) more than 450 million years ago and found in all extant jawed vertebrate species from fishes to humans. IG are anchored in the membrane of a B cell as part of a signaling B cell receptor (BcR = membrane IG+CD79) or are secreted by plasmocytes. IG recognize antigens in their native (unprocessed) form. IG are made of two identical heavy (H) chains and two identical light (kappa or lambda) chains, encoded by genes located in three major loci: the IG heavy (IGH) locus at 14q32.33, IG kappa (IGK) locus at 2p11.2 and IG lambda (IGL) locus at 22q11.2. Genes outside of these major loci are orphons. There are four IG gene types, variable (V), diversity (D) (only for IGH), joining (J) and constant (C) genes which contribute to the IG chain synthesis. The variable domain at the N-terminal end of each IG chain results from a V-(D)-J rearrangement whereas the remaining of the chain, or constant region, is encoded by a C gene. The combinatorial and junctional diversity together with IG somatic hypermutations create a huge diversity of 1012 specific IG per individual, the limiting factor being only the number of B cells that an organism is genetically programmed to prod	IG		so:0005855

ARF family proteins are ubiquitous in eukaryotic cells, and six highly conserved members of the family have been identified in mammalian cells. Although ARFs are soluble, they generally associate with membranes because of N-terminus myristoylation. They function as regulators of vesicular traffic and actin remodelling. The small ADP ribosylation factor (Arf) GTP-binding proteins are major regulators of vesicle biogenesis in intracellular traffic.

370	T cell receptors	T cell receptors (TR) are antigen receptors of the T cells of the adaptive immune response, acquired by jawed vertebrates (or gnathostomata) more than 450 million years ago and found in all extant jawed vertebrate species from fishes to humans. TR are anchored in the membrane of a T cell as part of the signaling T cell receptor (TcR = TR+CD3). TR alpha/beta recognize processed antigens, which are presented as peptides by the highly polymorphic major histocompatibility (MH, in humans HLA for human leukocyte antigens) proteins, whereas TR gamma/delta recognize nonpeptidic antigens. TR are made of two chains, alpha and beta, or gamma and delta, encoded by genes located in four major loci: the TR alpha (TRA) at 14q11.2, TR beta (TRB) at 7q34, TR gamma (TRG) at 7p14 and TR delta (TRD) at 14q11.2. Genes outside of these major loci are orphons. There are four TR gene types, variable (V), diversity (D) (for TRB and TRD), joining (J) and constant (C) genes which contribute to the TR chain synthesis. The variable domain at the N-terminal end of each TR chain results from a V-(D)-J rearrangement whereas the remaining of the chain, or constant region, is encoded by a C gene.

388	RAB, member RAS oncogene GTPases	The Rab family of proteins is a member of the Ras superfamily of monomeric G proteins. Rab GTPases regulate many steps of membrane traffic, including vesicle formation, vesicle movement along actin and tubulin networks, and membrane fusion. These processes make up the route through which cell surface proteins are trafficked from the Golgi to the plasma membrane and are recycled. Surface protein recycling returns proteins to the surface whose function involves carrying another protein or substance inside the cell, such as the transferrin receptor, or serves as a means of regulating the number of a certain type of protein molecules on the surface.

In humans and many other animals, they serve to break down alcohols that otherwise are toxic, and they also participate in generation of useful aldehyde, ketone, or alcohol groups during biosynthesis of various metabolites.

402	Anaphase promoting complex 	This article refers to the cell-cycle regulatory complex, APC/C. For the tumor suppressor APC, in which mutations lead to colon cancer, see Adenomatous polyposis coli. Anaphase-Promoting Complex (also called the cyclosome or APCC is a large complex of 11-13 subunit proteins, including a cullin (Apc2) and RING (Apc11) subunit much like SCF. Other parts of the APC/C still have unknown functions, but are highly conserved.  It was the discovery of the APC/C (and SCF ) and their key role in eukaryotic cell reproduction that established once and for all the importance of ubiquitin -mediated proteolysis in eukaryotic cell biology. Once perceived as a system exclusively involved in removing damaged protein from the cell, ubiquitination and subsequent protein degradation by the proteasome is now perceived as a universal regulatory mechanism for signal transduction whose importance approaches that of protein phosphorylation. In 2014, the APC/C was mapped in 3D at a resolution of less than a nanometre, which also uncovered its secondary structure. Researchers have claimed this finding could transform the understanding of cancer and reveal new binding sites for future cancer drugs.  	ANAPC		so:0005855	
403	Ankyrin repeat domain containing	Protein containing at least one ANK repeat, a conserved domain of approximately 33 amino acids, that was originally identified in ankyrin. It has been described as an L-shaped structure consisting of a beta-hairpin and two alpha-helices. Many ankyrin repeat regions are known to function as protein-protein interaction domains.

404	Annexins	Annexin is a common name for a group of cellular proteins. They are mostly found in eukaryotic organisms (animal, plant and fungi). In humans, the annexins are found inside the cell. However some annexins (Annexin A1, Annexin A2, and Annexin A5) have also been found outside the cellular environment, for example, in blood. How the annexins are transported out of the cell into the blood is a mystery because they lack a signal peptide necessary for proteins to be transported out of the cell.  Annexin is also known as lipocortin. Lipocortins suppress phospholipase A2. Increased expression of the gene coding for annexin-1 is one of the mechanisms by which glucocorticoids (such as cortisol ) inhibit inflammation.	ANXA		so:0005855	
405	Apolipoproteins	Protein or apolipoprotein associated with High-Density Lipoproteins (HDL), a class of proteins involved in lipid (cholesterol, phospholipids and triacylglycerol) metabolism in the body fluids. HDL are formed in the liver and are involved in reverse cholesterol transport, the transport of cholesterol from peripherical tissues to the liver. Apolipoproteins are proteins which are specifically associated with lipoproteins, which is not the case for all the proteins associated with HDL or with the other lipoprotein classes.	APO		so:0005855	
406	Apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic subunits	APOBEC ('apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like') is a family of evolutionary conserved proteins. A mechanism of generating protein diversity is mRNA editing. Members of this family are C-to-U editing enzymes. The N-terminal domain of APOBEC like proteins is the catalytic domain, while the C-terminal domain is a pseudocatalytic domain. More specifically, the catalytic domain is a zinc dependent cytidine deaminase domain and is essential for cytidine deamination. RNA editing by APOBEC-1 requires homodimerisation and this complex interacts with RNA binding proteins to form the editosome.	APOBEC		so:0005855

409	Armadillo repeat containing	Armadillo repeat is the name of a characteristic, repetitive amino acid sequence found in β-catenin and many other proteins, like α-importin, plakoglobin,or adenomatous polyposis coli (APC). Its name derives from the historical name of the β-catenin gene in the fruitfly Drosophila: where they were first discovered. Armadillo repeats are approximately 40 amino acids long and proteins that contain them usually have many tandemly repeated copies. These tandem repeats usually fold together to form a single, rigid protein domain called the armadillo (ARM) domain. Because ARM domains can consist of a variable number of repeats, they are a good example of solenoid protein domains. The best characterized example of armadillo domains is found in β-catenin. β-catenin is a protein involved in linking cadherin cell adhesion proteins to the cytoskeleton, but the Armadillo repeat is found in a wide range of proteins with other functions. This type of protein domain is important in transducing WNT signals during embryonic development.	ARMC		hgnc.genegroup:1492

410	Sulfatases	Sulfatases EC 3.1.6. are enzymes of the esterase class that catalyze the hydrolysis of sulfate esters. These may be found on a range of substrates, including steroids, carbohydrates and proteins. Sulfate esters may be formed from various alcohols and amines. In the latter case the resultant N-sulfates can also be termed sulfamates. Sulfatases play important roles in the cycling of sulfur in the environment, in the degradation of sulfated glycosaminoglycans and glycolipids in the lysosome, and in remodelling sulfated glycosaminoglycans in the extracellular space. Together with sulfotransferases, sulfatases form the major catalytic machinery for the synthesis and breakage of sulfate esters.	ARS		so:0005855	
412	ATPases	This family page represents all types of ATPases found in human.  V-type and F-type ATPases are both rotor protein complexes and are related in structure and function.  The V-type ATPase hydrolyses ATP to pump protons across membranes while the F-type ATPase couples proton transfer to synthesis of ATP from ADP.  The AAA and P-type families are unrelated and comprise many individual members.  The AAA ATPase family hydrolyse ATP to obtain energy for a diverse variety of biological processes.  P-type ATPases use the energy from ATP hydrolysis to pump ions across cellular membranes.			so:0005855	
413	AAA ATPases	AAA or AAA+ is an abbreviation for ATPases Associated with diverse cellular Activities. They share a common conserved module of approximately 230 amino acid residues. This is a large, functionally diverse protein family belonging to the AAA+ superfamily of ring-shaped P-loop NTPases, which exert their activity through the energy-dependent remodeling or translocation of macromolecules.  AAA proteins couple chemical energy provided by ATP hydrolysis to conformational changes which are transduced into mechanical force exerted on a macromolecular substrate.  AAA proteins are functionally and organizationally diverse, and vary in activity, stability, and mechanism.  Members of the AAA family are found in all organisms  and they are essential for many cellular functions. They are involved in processes such as DNA replication, protein degradation, membrane fusion, microtubule severing, peroxisome biogenesis, signal transduction and the regulation of gene expression.

414	P-type ATPases	The P-type ATPases, also known as E1-E2 ATPases, are a large group of evolutionarily related ion and lipid pumps that are found in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. They are alpha-helical bundle primary transporters referred to as P-type ATPases because they catalyze auto- (or self-) phosphorylation of a key conserved aspartate residue within the pump. In addition, they all appear to interconvert between at least two different conformations, denoted by E1 and E2. Most members of this transporter family are specific for the pumping of a large array of cations, however one subfamily is involved in flipping phospholipids to maintain the asymmetric nature of the biomembrane. Prominent examples of P-type ATPases are the sodium-potassium pump (Na +,K +-ATPase), the plasma membrane proton pump (H +-ATPase), the proton-potassium pump (H +,K +-ATPase), and the calcium pump (Ca 2+ -ATPase).			hgnc.genegroup:412	
415	V-type ATPase subunits	Vacuolar-type H +-ATPase ( V-ATPase ) is a highly conserved evolutionarily ancient enzyme with remarkably diverse functions in eukaryotic organisms.  V-ATPases acidify a wide array of intracellular organelles and pump protons across the plasma membranes of numerous cell types. V-ATPases couple the energy of ATP hydrolysis to proton transport across intracellular and plasma membranes of eukaryotic cells.	ATP6V		hgnc.genegroup:412	
417	ATP binding cassette transporters	ATP-binding cassette transporters ( ABC transporters ) are members of a protein superfamily that is one of the largest and most ancient families with representatives in all extant phyla from prokaryotes to humans.  ABC transporters are transmembrane proteins that utilize the energy of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding and hydrolysis to carry out certain biological processes including translocation of various substrates across membranes and non-transport-related processes such as translation of RNA and DNA repair.  They transport a wide variety of substrates across extra- and intracellular membranes, including metabolic products, lipids and sterols, and drugs. Proteins are classified as ABC transporters based on the sequence and organization of their ATP-binding cassette (ABC) domain(s). ABC transporters are involved in tumor resistance, cystic fibrosis and a range of other inherited human diseases along with both bacterial (prokaryotic) and eukaryotic (including human) development of resistance to multiple drugs.	ABC		so:0005855	
418	AT-rich interaction domain containing	In molecular biology, the ARID domain (AT-rich interaction domain; also known as BRIGHT domain))  is a protein domain that binds to DNA. ARID domain-containing proteins are found in fungi and invertebrate and vertebrate metazoans. ARID-encoding genes are involved in a variety of biological processes including embryonic development, cell lineage gene regulation and cell cycle control. Although the specific roles of this domain and of ARID-containing proteins in transcriptional regulation are yet to be elucidated, they include both positive and negative transcriptional regulation and a likely involvement in the modification of chromatin structure.  The basic structure of the ARID domain appears to be a series of six alpha-helices separated by beta-strands, loops, or turns, but the structured region may extend to an additional helix at either or both ends of the basic six. Based on primary sequence homology, they can be partitioned into three structural classes: Minimal ARID proteins that consist of a core domain formed by six alpha helices; ARID proteins that supplement the core domain with an N-terminal alpha-helix; and Extended-ARID proteins, which contain the core domain and additional alpha-helices at their N- and C-termini.

BIR domains belong to the zinc-finger domain family and characteristically have a number of invariant amino acid residues, including 3 conserved cysteines and one conserved histidine, which coordinate a zinc ion.

434	Fucosyltransferases	A fucosyltransferase is an enzyme that transfers an L- fucose sugar from a GDP-fucose ( guanosine diphosphate -fucose) donor substrate to an acceptor substrate. The acceptor substrate can be another sugar such as the transfer of a fucose to a core GlcNAc ( N-acetylglucosamine ) sugar as in the case of N-linked glycosylation, or to a protein, as in the case of O -linked glycosylation produced by O -fucosyltransferase. There are various fucosyltransferases in mammals, the vast majority of which, are located in the Golgi apparatus. The O -fucosyltransferases have recently been shown to localize to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Some of the proteins in this group are responsible for the molecular basis of the blood group antigens, surface markers on the outside of the red blood cell membrane. Most of these markers are proteins, but some are carbohydrates attached to lipids or proteins.

Animal sialyltransferases are gathered in a unique group of the CAZy classification (GT#29). Within this group, four families are distinguished based on the glycosidic linkage formed and the monosaccharide acceptor (ST3Gal, ST6Gal, ST6GalNAc and ST8Sia).			hgnc.genegroup:424

455	Bone morphogenetic proteins	Bone morphogenetic proteins ( BMPs ) are a group of growth factors also known as cytokines and as metabologens. Originally discovered by their ability to induce the formation of bone and cartilage, BMPs are now considered to constitute a group of pivotal morphogenetic signals, orchestrating tissue architecture throughout the body.  The important functioning of BMP signals in physiology is emphasized by the multitude of roles for dysregulated BMP signalling in pathological processes. Cancerous disease often involves misregulation of the BMP signalling system. Absence of BMP signalling is, for instance, an important factor in the progression of colon cancer,  and conversely, overactivation of BMP signalling following reflux-induced esophagitis provokes Barrett's esophagus and is thus instrumental in the development of adenocarcinoma in the proximal portion of the gastrointestinal tract.

Butyrophilin (Btn) genes constitute a subgroup of at least 10 genes in the Ig superfamily identified in human, mouse, cow, goat and other species.  The eponymous Btn gene (BTN1A1 in humans; Btn1a1 in mouse) is highly expressed in the secretory epithelium of the mammary gland during lactation. Other homologues are predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle and the intestine and erythroid cells. In contrast, BTN2A1 and 2 and BTN3A1, 2, and 3 are widely expressed in many tissues, suggesting that the structural domains of Btn proteins may have both universal and tissue-specific functions.

There are at least 21 different S-100 proteins. Their name is derived from the fact that these proteins are soluble in 100%, i.e. saturated ammonium sulfate at neutral pH.

460	Carbonic anhydrases	The carbonic anhydrases (or carbonate dehydratases ) form a family of enzymes that catalyze the rapid interconversion of carbon dioxide and water to bicarbonate and protons (or vice versa), a reversible reaction that occurs rather slowly in the absence of a catalyst.  The active site of most carbonic anhydrases contains a zinc ion; they are therefore classified as metalloenzymes. One of the functions of the enzyme in animals is to interconvert carbon dioxide and bicarbonate to maintain acid-base balance in blood and other tissues, and to help transport carbon dioxide out of tissues.

There are four major classes, termed A, B, C and D, distinguished by the type of reaction which they catalyze:  Phospholipase A  Phospholipase A1 - cleaves the SN-1 acyl chain. Phospholipase A2 - cleaves the SN-2 acyl chain, releasing arachidonic acid.   Phospholipase B - cleaves both SN-1 and SN-2 acyl chains ; this enzyme is also known as a lysophospholipase. Phospholipase C - cleaves before the phosphate, releasing diacylglycerol and a phosphate-containing head group. Phospholipase Cs play a central role in signal transduction, releasing the second messenger inositol triphosphate. Phospholipase D - cleaves after the phosphate, releasing phosphatidic acid and an alcohol.  Types C and D are considered phosphodiesterases. Phospholipase A2 acts on the intact lecithin molecule and hydrolyses the fatty acid esterified to the second carbon atom. The resulting products are lysolecithin and a fatty acid. Phospholipase A2 is an enzyme present in the venom of bees and viper snakes.			so:0005855	
468	Caspases	Caspases, or cysteine-aspartic proteases or cysteine-dependent aspartate-directed proteases are a family of cysteine proteases that play essential roles in apoptosis (programmed cell death), necrosis, and inflammation. Caspases are essential in cells for apoptosis, or programmed cell death, in development and most other stages of adult life, and have been termed 'executioner' proteins for their roles in the cell. Some caspases are also required in the immune system for the maturation of lymphocytes. Failure of apoptosis is one of the main contributions to tumour development and autoimmune diseases; this, coupled with the unwanted apoptosis that occurs with ischemia or Alzheimer's disease, has stimulated interest in caspases as potential therapeutic targets since they were discovered in the mid-1990s.

There are approximately a dozen members of this family, which are distinguished by their structure, catalytic mechanism, and which proteins they cleave. Most of the members become activated at the low pH found in lysosomes. Thus, the activity of this family lies almost entirely within those organelles. There are, however, exceptions such as cathepsin K, which works extracellularly after secretion by osteoclasts in bone resorption. Cathepsins have a vital role in mammalian cellular turnover, e.g. bone resorption. They degrade polypeptides and are distinguished by their substrate specificities.	CTS		hgnc.genegroup:2109

In terms of physiology, CD molecules can act in numerous ways, often acting as receptors or ligands (the molecule that activates a receptor) important to the cell. A signal cascade is usually initiated, altering the behavior of the cell (see cell signaling). Some CD proteins do not play a role in cell signaling, but have other functions, such as cell adhesion.

Less-frequently used synonyms are non-protein-coding RNA (npcRNA), non-messenger RNA (nmRNA) and functional RNA (fRNA). The term small RNA (sRNA) is often used for short bacterial ncRNAs. The DNA sequence from which a non-coding RNA is transcribed is often called an RNA gene. Non-coding RNA genes include highly abundant and functionally important RNAs such as transfer RNA (tRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), as well as RNAs such as snoRNAs, microRNAs, siRNAs, snRNAs, exRNAs, and piRNAs and the long ncRNAs that include examples such as Xist and HOTAIR (see here for a more complete list of ncRNAs). The number of ncRNAs encoded within the human genome is unknown, however recent transcriptomic and bioinformatic studies suggest the existence of thousands of ncRNAs., but see  Since many of the newly identified ncRNAs have not been validated for their function, it is possible that many are non-functional.			so:0005855	
476	MicroRNAs	A microRNA (abbr. miRNA) is a small non-coding RNA molecule (ca. 22 nucleotides ) found in plants, animals, and some viruses, which functions in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Encoded by eukaryotic nuclear DNA in plants and animals and by viral DNA in certain viruses whose genome is based on DNA, miRNAs function via base-pairing with complementary sequences within mRNA molecules. As a result, these mRNA strands are silenced because they can no longer be translated into proteins by ribosomes, and such complexes are often actively disassembled by the cell ('target degradation').  The human genome may encode over 1000 miRNAs,  which may target about 60% of mammalian genes and are abundant in many human cell types.  	MIR		hgnc.genegroup:475	
478	Transfer RNAs	A Transfer RNA (abbreviated tRNA and archaically referred to as sRNA abbreviating soluble RNA) is an adaptor molecule composed of RNA, typically 73 to 94 nucleotides in length, that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids ( DNA and RNA ) and the amino acid sequence of proteins. It does this by carrying an amino acid to the protein synthetic machinery of a cell ( ribosome ) as directed by a three-nucleotide sequence ( codon ) in a messenger RNA (mRNA). As such, tRNAs are a necessary component of protein translation, the biological synthesis of new proteins according to the genetic code. The specific nucleotide sequence of an mRNA specifies which amino acids are incorporated into the protein product of the gene from which the mRNA is transcribed, and the role of tRNA is to specify which sequence from the genetic code corresponds to which amino acid.  One end of the tRNA matches the genetic code in a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon. The anticodon forms three base pairs with a codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis. The mRNA encodes a protein as a series of contiguous codons, each of which is recognized by a particular tRNA. On the other end of the tRNA is a covalent attachment to the amino acid that corresponds to the anticodon sequence. Each type of tRNA molecule can be attached to only one type of amino acid, so each organism has many types of tRNA (in fact, because the genetic code contains multiple codons that specify the same amino acid, there are many tRNA molecules bearing different anticodons which also carry the same amino acid).

483	Chemokine ligands	Chemokines (Greek -kinos, movement) are a family of small cytokines, or signaling proteins secreted by cells. Their name is derived from their ability to induce directed chemotaxis in nearby responsive cells; they are chemo tactic cyto kines. Proteins are classified as chemokines according to shared structural characteristics such as small size (they are all approximately 8-10 kilodaltons in size), and the presence of four cysteine residues in conserved locations that are key to forming their 3-dimensional shape. However, these proteins have historically been known under several other names including the SIS family of cytokines, SIG family of cytokines, SCY family of cytokines, Platelet factor-4 superfamily or intercrines. Some chemokines are considered pro- inflammatory and can be induced during an immune response to recruit cells of the immune system to a site of infection, while others are considered homeostatic and are involved in controlling the migration of cells during normal processes of tissue maintenance or development. Chemokines are found in all vertebrates, some viruses and some bacteria, but none have been described for other invertebrates. Chemokines have been classified into four main subfamilies : CXC, CC, CX3C and XC. All of these proteins exert their biological effects by interacting with G protein -linked transmembrane receptors called chemokine receptors, that are selectively found on the surfaces of their target cells.

It forms insoluble fibres of high tensile strength and which contains the unusual amino acids hyroxyproline and hydroxylysine. It is rich in glycine but lacks cysteine and tryptophan, and has an unusually regular amino-acid domain.	COL		so:0005855	
491	Collectins	Collectins (collagen-containing C-type lectins) are a part of the innate immune system. They form a family of collagenous Ca 2+ -dependent defense lectins, which are found in animals. Collectins are soluble pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Their function is to bind to oligosaccharide structure or lipids which are on the surface of microorganisms. Like other PRRs they bind pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and also danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) of oligosaccharide origin. Binding of collectins to microorganisms may trigger elimination of microorganisms by aggregation, complement activation, opsonization, activation of phagocytosis or inhibition of microbial growth. Other functions of collectins are modulation of inflammatory, allergic responses, adaptive immune system and clearance of apoptotic cells.	COLEC		so:0005855	
492	Complement system	The complement system helps or 'complements' the ability of antibodies and phagocytic cells to clear pathogens from an organism. It is part of the immune system called the innate immune system  that is not adaptable and does not change over the course of an individual's lifetime. However, it can be recruited and brought into action by the adaptive immune system. The complement system consists of a number of small proteins found in the blood, in general synthesized by the liver, and normally circulating as inactive precursors (pro-proteins). When stimulated by one of several triggers, proteases in the system cleave specific proteins to release cytokines and initiate an amplifying cascade of further cleavages. The end-result of this activation cascade is massive amplification of the response and activation of the cell-killing membrane attack complex. Over 30 proteins and protein fragments make up the complement system, including serum proteins, serosal proteins, and cell membrane receptors. They account for about 5% of the globulin fraction of blood serum and can serve as opsonins.			so:0005855

496	Cyclin dependent kinases	Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are a family of protein kinases first discovered for their role in regulating the cell cycle. They are also involved in regulating transcription, mRNA processing, and the differentiation of nerve cells.  They are present in all known eukaryotes, and their regulatory function in the cell cycle has been evolutionarily conserved. In fact, yeast cells can proliferate normally when their CDK gene has been replaced with the homologous human gene.  CDKs are relatively small proteins, with molecular weights ranging from 34 to 40 kDa, and contain little more than the kinase domain.  By definition, a CDK binds a regulatory protein called a cyclin. Without cyclin, CDK has little kinase activity; only the cyclin-CDK complex is an active kinase. CDKs phosphorylate their substrates on serines and threonines, so they are serine-threonine kinases.  The consensus sequence for the phosphorylation site in the amino acid sequence of a CDK substrate is PX, where S/T* is the phosphorylated serine or threonine, P is proline, X is any amino acid, K is lysine, and R is arginine	CDK		so:0005855

502	Defensins, alpha	Alpha defensins are a family of mammalian defensin peptides. Defensins are 2-6 kDa, cationic, microbicidal peptides active against many Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, fungi, and enveloped viruses,  containing three pairs of intramolecular disulfide bonds. On the basis of their size and pattern of disulfide bonding, mammalian defensins are classified into alpha, beta and theta categories. Alpha-defensins, which have been identified in humans, monkeys and several rodent species, are particularly abundant in neutrophils, certain macrophage populations and Paneth cells of the small intestine. 	DEFA		hgnc.genegroup:501	
503	Defensins, beta	Beta defensins are a family of mammalian defensins. The beta defensins are antimicrobial peptides implicated in the resistance of epithelial surfaces to microbial colonization. Defensins are 2-6 kDa, cationic, microbicidal peptides active against many Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, fungi, and enveloped viruses,  containing three pairs of intramolecular disulfide bonds. On the basis of their size and pattern of disulfide bonding, mammalian defensins are classified into alpha, beta and theta categories. Every mammalian species explored thus far has beta-defensins. In cows, as many as 13 beta-defensins exist in neutrophils. However, in other species, beta-defensins are more often produced by epithelial cells lining various organs (e.g. the epidermis, bronchial tree and genitourinary tract. Human, rabbit and guinea-pig beta-defensins, as well as human beta-defensin-2 (hBD2), induce the activation and degranulation of mast cells, resulting in the release of histamine and prostaglandin D2.

The DNA binding region comprises a number of basic amino acids such as arginine and lysine. Proteins containing this domain are transcription factors.			so:0005855	
508	Forkhead boxes	FOX (Forkhead box) proteins are a family of transcription factors that play important roles in regulating the expression of genes involved in cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and longevity. Many FOX proteins are important to embryonic development.  FOX proteins also have pioneering transcription activity by being able to bind condensed chromatin during cell differentiation processes.  The defining feature of FOX proteins is the forkhead box, a sequence of 80 to 100 amino acids forming a motif that binds to DNA. This forkhead motif is also known as the winged helix due to the butterfly-like appearance of the loops in the protein structure of the domain.  Forkhead genes are a subgroup of the helix-turn-helix class of proteins.	FOX		so:0005855

536	Dyneins, axonemal	Axonemal dyneins come in multiple forms that contain either one, two or three non-identical heavy chains (depending upon the organism and location in the cilium). Each heavy chain has a globular motor domain with a doughnut-shaped structure believed to resemble that of other AAA proteins, a coiled coil 'stalk' that binds to the microtubule, and an extended tail (or 'stem') that attaches to a neighboring microtubule of the same axoneme. Each dynein molecule thus forms a cross-bridge between two adjacent microtubules of the ciliary axoneme.	DNA		hgnc.genegroup:537	
537	Dyneins	Dynein is a motor protein (also called molecular motor or motor molecule) in cells which converts the chemical energy contained in ATP into the mechanical energy of movement. Dynein transports various cellular cargo by 'walking' along cytoskeletal microtubules towards the minus-end of the microtubule, which is usually oriented towards the cell center. Thus, they are called 'minus-end directed motors.' This form of transport is known as retrograde transport. In contrast, kinesins, which are motor proteins that move toward the microtubules' plus end, are called plus-end directed motors.			so:0005855	
538	Dyneins, cytoplasmic	Cytoplasmic dynein, which has a molecular mass of about 1.5 megadaltons (MDa), contains approximately twelve polypeptide subunits: two identical 'heavy chains', 520 kDa in mass, which contain the ATPase activity and are thus responsible for generating movement along the microtubule; two 74 kDa intermediate chains which are believed to anchor the dynein to its cargo; four 53–59 kDa intermediate chains; and several light chains which are less understood.

It is found in association with other domains, such as C1q, laminin-type EGF-like, collagen-like, FN3, WAP, ZP or FAS1.

Ephrin receptors in turn compose the largest known subfamily of receptor protein-tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Since ephrin ligands (ephrins) and Eph receptors (Ephs) are both membrane-bound proteins, binding and activation of Ephepherin signaling regulates a variety of biological processes during embryonic development including the guidance of axon growth cones, formation of tissue boundaries,  cell migration, and segmentation. Additionally, Eph/epherin signaling has recently been identified to play a critical role in the maintenance of several processes during adulthood including long-term potentiation, angiogenesis, and stem cell differentiation.

556	Fibulins	Fibulin (FY-beau-lin) (now known as Fibulin-1 FBLN1 ) is the prototypic member of a multigene family, currently with seven members. Fibulin-1 is a calcium-binding glycoprotein. In vertebrates, fibulin-1 is found in blood and extracellular matrices. In the extracellular matrix, fibulin-1 associates with basement membranes and elastic fibers. The association with these matrix structures is mediated by its ability to interact with numerous extracellular matrix constituents including fibronectin, proteoglycans, laminins and tropoelastin. In blood, fibulin-1 binds to fibrinogen and incorporates into clots. Fibulins are secreted glycoproteins that become incorporated into a fibrillar extracellular matrix when expressed by cultured cells or added exogenously to cell monolayers.  The five known members of the family share an elongated structure and many calcium-binding sites, owing to the presence of tandem arrays of epidermal growth factor-like domains. They have overlapping binding sites for several basement-membrane proteins, tropoelastin, fibrillin, fibronectin and proteoglycans, and they participate in diverse supramolecular structures. The amino-terminal domain I of fibulin consists of three anaphylatoxin -like (AT) modules, each approximately 40 residues long and containing four or six cysteines. The structure of an AT module was determined for the complement-derived anaphylatoxin C3a, and was found to be a compact alpha-helical fold that is stabilized by three disulphide bridges in the pattern Cys14, Cys25 and Cys36 (where Cys is cysteine). The bulk of the remaining portion of the fibulin molecule is a series of nine EGF-like repeats.	FBLN		so:0005855	
557	F-boxes	F-box proteins are proteins containing at least one F-box domain. The first identified F-box protein is one of three components of the SCF complex, which mediates ubiquitination of proteins targeted for degradation by the proteasome. F-box proteins have also been associated with cellular functions such as signal transduction and regulation of the cell cycle. In plants, many F-box proteins are represented in gene networks broadly regulated by microRNA -mediated gene silencing via RNA interference. In human cells, in high-iron condition, two iron atoms stabilise the F-Box FBXL5 and then the complex mediates the ubiquitination of IRP2. The F-box domain is a protein structural motif of about 50 amino acids that mediates proteinâprotein interactions. It was first identified in cyclin F. The F-box motif interacts directly with the SCF protein Skp1, and F-box domains commonly exist in proteins in concert with other proteinâprotein interaction motifs such as leucine-rich repeats and WD repeats, which are thought to mediate interactions with SCF substrates.

Kindlins have been linked to Kindler syndrome, leukocyte adhesion deficiency, cancer and other acquired human diseases. They are essential in the organisation of focal adhesions that mediate cell-extracellular matrix junctions and are involved in other cellular compartments that control cell-cell contacts and nucleus functioning. Therefore they are responsible for cell to cell crosstalk via cell-cell contacts and integrin mediated cell adhesion through focal adhesion proteins and as specialised adhesion structures of hematopoietic cells they are also present in podosome's F actin surrounding ring structure.

562	Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors	The GABA receptors are a class of receptors that respond to the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the chief inhibitory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate central nervous system. There are two classes of GABA receptors: GABA A and GABA B. GABA A receptors are ligand-gated ion channels (also known as ionotropic receptors), whereas GABA B receptors are G protein-coupled receptors (also known as metabotropic receptors ).			so:0005855	
563	Gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor subunits	The GABA A receptor (GABA AR) is an ionotropic receptor and ligand-gated ion channel. Its endogenous ligand is gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. Upon activation, the GABA A receptor selectively conducts Cl- through its pore, resulting in hyperpolarization of the neuron. This causes an inhibitory effect on neurotransmission by diminishing the chance of a successful action potential occurring.

Heat shock proteins, as a class, are among the most highly expressed cellular proteins across all species.  As their name implies, heat shock proteins protect cells when stressed by elevated temperatures. They account for 1-2% of total protein in unstressed cells. However, when cells are heated, the fraction of heat shock proteins increases to 4-6% of cellular proteins. 	HSP90		hgnc.genegroup:582

Importin is classified as a karyopherin.  Importin has two subunits, importin alpha and importin beta. Members of the importin-beta family can bind and transport cargo by themselves, or can form heterodimers with importin-alpha.	IPO		so:0005855	
597	Integrins	Protein of the integrin family of cell surface heterodimeric receptors that mediates dynamic cell-to-cell as well as cell-to-matrix adhesion. Integrins function as mechanochemical sensors and transducers able to change rapidly and reversibly their adhesive functions by modulating their ligand-binding affinity. Each subunit has a large N-terminal extracellular domain followed by a transmembrane domain and a short C-terminal cytoplasmic region. Some subclasses of integrins share a common beta chain while having different alpha chains.	ITG		so:0005855

They allow for communication between cells to trigger the protective defenses of the immune system that eradicate pathogens or tumors. IFNs belong to the large class of glycoproteins known as cytokines. Interferons are named after their ability to 'interfere' with viral replication within host cells. IFNs have other functions: they activate immune cells, such as natural killer cells and macrophages ; they increase recognition of infection or tumor cells by up-regulating antigen presentation to T lymphocytes ; and they increase the ability of uninfected host cells to resist new infection by virus. Certain symptoms, such as aching muscles and fever, are related to the production of IFNs during infection. 	IFN		hgnc.genegroup:542

The function of the immune system depends in a large part on interleukins, and rare deficiencies of a number of them have been described, all featuring autoimmune diseases or immune deficiency. The majority of interleukins are synthesized by helper CD4 T lymphocytes, as well as through monocytes, macrophages, and endothelial cells.

They generally form filamentous structures 8 to 14 nm wide and intermediate in size between microtubules and microfilaments. This family of protein includes cytokeratins, vimentin, desmin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, neurofilament proteins and nestin. All IF proteins are structurally similar in that they consist of: a central rod domain which is arranged in coiled-coiled alpha-helices, with at least two short characteristic interruptions; an N-terminal non-helical domain (head) of variable length; and an C-terminal domain (tail) which is also non-helical and shows extreme length variation between different IF proteins.			so:0005855

The process of IFT has been best characterized in the biflagellate alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as well as the sensory cilia of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. It has been suggested based on localization studies that IFT proteins also function outside of cilia.			so:0005855

In humans, plasma kallikrein ( KLKB1 ) has no known homologue, while tissue kallikrein-related peptidases ( KLKs ) encode a family of fifteen closely related serine proteases. These genes are localised to chromosome 19q13, forming the largest contiguous cluster of proteases within the human genome.

620	Killer cell immunoglobulin like receptors	Killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs), are a family of cell surface proteins found on important cells of the immune system called natural killer (NK) cells. They regulate the killing function of these cells by interacting with MHC class I molecules, which are expressed on all cell types. This interaction allows them to detect virally infected cells or tumor cells that have a characteristic low level of Class I MHC on their surface. Most KIRs are inhibitory, meaning that their recognition of MHC suppresses the cytotoxic activity of their NK cell. Only a limited number of KIRs have the ability to activate cells.  KIR molecules are highly polymorphic, meaning their gene sequences differ greatly between individuals, so that different individuals possess different arrays/repertoires of KIR genes.

Kinesins move along microtubule filaments, and are powered by the hydrolysis of ATP (thus kinesins are ATPases ). The active movement of kinesins supports several cellular functions including mitosis, meiosis and transport of cellular cargo, such as in axonal transport. Most kinesins walk towards the plus end of a microtubule, which, in most cells, entails transporting cargo from the centre of the cell towards the periphery. This form of transport is known as anterograde transport. In contrast, dyneins are motor proteins that move toward the microtubules' minus end.	KIF		so:0005855

Mucins' key characteristic is their ability to form gels; therefore they are a key component in most gel-like secretions, serving functions from lubrication to cell signalling to forming chemical barriers.  They often take an inhibitory role.  Some mucins are associated with controlling mineralization, including nacre formation in mollusks, calcification in echinoderms  and bone formation in vertebrates.  They bind to pathogens as part of the immune system. Overexpression of the mucin proteins, especially MUC1, is associated with many types of cancer.

Following the discovery by Pollard and Korn of enzymes with myosin-like function in Acanthamoeba castellanii, a large number of divergent myosin genes have been discovered throughout eukaryotes. Thus, although myosin was originally thought to be restricted to muscle cells (hence, 'myo'), there is no single 'myosin' but rather a huge superfamily of genes whose protein products share the basic properties of actin binding, ATP hydrolysis (ATPase enzyme activity), and force transduction. Virtually all eukaryotic cells contain myosin isoforms. Some isoforms have specialized functions in certain cell types (such as muscle), while other isoforms are ubiquitous.

71	Nuclear hormone receptors	In the field of molecular biology, nuclear receptors are a class of proteins found within cells that are responsible for sensing steroid and thyroid hormones and certain other molecules. In response, these receptors work with other proteins to regulate the expression of specific genes, thereby controlling the development, homeostasis, and metabolism of the organism. Nuclear receptors have the ability to directly bind to DNA and regulate the expression of adjacent genes, hence these receptors are classified as transcription factors.  The regulation of gene expression by nuclear receptors generally only happens when a ligand - a molecule that affects the receptor's behavior - is present. More specifically, ligand binding to a nuclear receptor results in a conformational change in the receptor, which, in turn, activates the receptor, resulting in up-regulation or down-regulation of gene expression. A unique property of nuclear receptors that differentiates them from other classes of receptors is their ability to directly interact with and control the expression of genomic DNA. As a consequence, nuclear receptors play key roles in both embryonic development and adult homeostasis. As discussed below, nuclear receptors may be classified according to either mechanism  or homology.	NR		hgnc.genegroup:26	
711	Dual specificity phosphatases	Dual-specificity phosphatase is a form of phosphatase that can act upon tyrosine or serine / threonine residues.  All [DUSPs] share a similar catalytic mechanism, by which a conserved cysteine residue forms a covalent intermediate with the phosphate group to be eliminated. The residues surrounding their calatytic core obey a rather strict consensus: His-Cys-x-x-x-x-x-Arg-Ser. The serine side chain and an additional conserved aspartate play a central role in the elimination of the Cys-linked intermediate, thus completing their enzymatic cycle.  The main difference between tyrosine-specific phosphatases and dual-specificity phosphatases lies in the width of the latter enzymes' catalytic pocket: thus they can accommodate phosphorylated serine or threonine side chains as well as phosphorylated tyrosines.

However, HMG boxes can be very diverse in nature, with only a few amino acids being conserved between species. Sox genes are defined as containing the HMG box of a gene involved in sex determination called SRY, which resides on the Y-chromosome (Sox stands for Sry-related HMG box). There are 20 SOX genes present in humans and mice, and 8 present in Drosophila. Almost all Sox genes show at least 50% amino acid similarity with the HMG box in Sry.

817	Exosome complex	The exosome complex (or PM/Scl complex, often just called the exosome) is a multi-protein complex capable of degrading various types of RNA (ribonucleic acid) molecules. Exosome complexes are found in both eukaryotic cells and archaea, while in bacteria a simpler complex called the degradosome carries out similar functions. The core of the exosome contains a six-membered ring structure to which other proteins are attached. In eukaryotic cells, the exosome complex is present in the cytoplasm, nucleus and especially the nucleolus, although different proteins interact with the exosome complex in these compartments regulating the RNA degradation activity of the complex to substrates specific to these cell compartments. Substrates of the exosome include messenger RNA, ribosomal RNA, and many species of small RNAs. The exosome has an exoribonucleolytic function, meaning it degrades RNA starting at one end (the 3â€² end in this case), and in eukaryotes also an endoribonucleolytic function, meaning it cleaves RNA at sites within the molecule. Several proteins in the exosome are the target of autoantibodies in patients with specific autoimmune diseases (especially the PM/Scl overlap syndrome ) and some antimetabolitic chemotherapies for cancer function by blocking the activity of the exosome. In addition, mutations in exosome component 3 cause pontocerebellar hypoplasia and spinal motor neuron disease.	EXOSC		so:0005855

82	GATA zinc finger domain containing	In molecular biology, GATA zinc fingers are zinc-containing domains found in a number of transcription factors (including erythroid-specific transcription factor and nitrogen regulatory proteins). Some members of this class of zinc fingers specifically bind the DNA sequence (A/T)GATA(A/G) in the regulatory regions of genes., giving rise to the name of the domain. In these domains, a single zinc ion is coordinated by 4 cysteine residues. NMR studies have shown the core of the Znf to comprise 2 irregular anti-parallel beta-sheets and an alpha-helix, followed by a long loop to the C-terminal end of the finger. The N-terminal part, which includes the helix, is similar in structure, but not sequence, to the N-terminal zinc module of the glucocorticoid receptor DNA-binding domain. The helix and the loop connecting the 2 beta-sheets interact with the major groove of the DNA, while the C-terminal tail wraps around into the minor groove. Interactions between the Znf and DNA are mainly hydrophobic, explaining the preponderance of thymines in the binding site; a large number of interactions with the phosphate backbone have also been observed. Two GATA zinc fingers are found in GATA-family transcription factors. However, there are several proteins that only contain a single copy of the domain. It is also worth noting that many GATA-type Znfs (such as those found in the proteins GATAD2B and MTA1) have not been experimentally demonstrated to be DNA-binding domains. Furthermore, several GATA-type Znfs have been demonstrated to act as protein-recognition domains. For example, the N-terminal Znf of GATA1 binds specifically to a zinc finger from the transcriptional coregulator FOG1 (ZFPM1).	GATAD		hgnc.genegroup:26

In the case of alcohol as acceptor, the product is a sulfate (R-OSO 3 -), whereas an amine leads to a sulfo-amine (R-NH-SO 3 -).

831	Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase subunits	Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (also called phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinases, PI 3-kinases, PI(3)Ks, PI-3Ks or by the [HGNC] official stem symbol for the gene family, PI3K(s)) are a family of enzymes involved in cellular functions such as cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, motility, survival and intracellular trafficking, which in turn are involved in cancer. PI3Ks are a family of related intracellular signal transducer enzymes capable of phosphorylating the 3 position hydroxyl group of the inositol ring of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns).  The pathway, with oncogene PIK3CA and tumor suppressor PTEN, is implicated in insensitivity of cancer tumors to insulin and IGF1, in calorie restriction.	PIK3C		hgnc.genegroup:823

844	Small nucleolar RNAs	Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are a class of small RNA molecules that primarily guide chemical modifications of other RNAs, mainly ribosomal RNAs, transfer RNAs and small nuclear RNAs.			hgnc.genegroup:475	
845	Small nucleolar RNAs, C/D box	C/D box snoRNAs contain two short conserved sequence motifs, C (RUGAUGA) and D (CUGA), located near the 5' and 3' ends of the snoRNA, respectively. Short regions (~ 5 nucleotides) located upstream of the C box and downstream of the D box are usually base complementary and form a stem-box structure, which brings the C and D box motifs into close proximity. This stem-box structure has been shown to be essential for correct snoRNA synthesis and nucleolar localization.	SNORD		hgnc.genegroup:844	
846	Small nucleolar RNAs, H/ACA box	H/ACA box snoRNAs have a common secondary structure consisting of a two hairpins and two single-stranded regions termed a hairpin-hinge-hairpin-tail structure. H/ACA snoRNAs also contain conserved sequence motifs known as H box (consensus ANANNA) and the ACA box (ACA). Both motifs are usually located in the single-stranded regions of the secondary structure.	SNORA		hgnc.genegroup:844	
847	Small Cajal body-specific RNAs	Small Cajal body-specific RNAs (scaRNAs) are a class of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) that specifically localise to the Cajal body, a nuclear organelle involved in the biogenesis of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs or snurps). ScaRNAs guide the modification ( methylation and pseudouridylation ) of RNA polymerase II transcribed spliceosomal RNAs U1, U2, U4, U5 and U12. The first scaRNA identified was U85.  It is unlike typical snoRNAs in that it is a composite CACA box snoRNAs and can guide both pseudouridylation and 2'-O-methylation. Not all scaRNAs are composite C/D and H/ACA box snoRNA and most scaRNAs are structurally and functionally indistinguishable from snoRNAs, directing ribosomal RNA (rRNA) modification in the nucleolus.	SCARNA		hgnc.genegroup:844	
848	Ribosomal RNAs	In molecular biology, ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) is the RNA component of the ribosome, and is essential for protein synthesis in all living organisms. It constitutes the predominant material within the ribosome, which is approximately 60% rRNA and 40% protein by weight. Ribosomes contain two major rRNAs and 50 or more proteins. The ribosomal RNAs form two subunits, the large subunit (LSU) and small subunit (SSU). The LSU rRNA acts as a ribozyme, catalyzing peptide bond formation. rRNA sequences are widely used for working out evolutionary relationships among organisms, since they are of ancient origin and are found in all known forms of life.			hgnc.genegroup:475	
849	Small nuclear RNAs	Small nuclear ribonucleic acid (snRNA), also commonly referred to as U-RNA, is a class of small RNA molecules that are found within the splicing speckles and cajal bodies of the cell nucleus in eukaryotic cells. The length of an average snRNA is approximately 150 nucleotides. They are transcribed by either RNA polymerase II or RNA polymerase III, and studies have shown that their primary function is in the processing of pre- messenger RNA ( hnRNA ) in the nucleus. They have also been shown to aid in the regulation of transcription factors (7SK RNA) or RNA polymerase II (B2 RNA), and maintaining the telomeres. 			hgnc.genegroup:475	
85	Zinc fingers MIZ-type	In molecular biology the MIZ-type zinc finger domain is a zinc finger-containing protein with homology to the yeast protein, Nfi-1. Miz1 is a sequence specific DNA binding protein that can function as a positive-acting transcription factor. Miz1 binds to the homeobox protein Msx2, enhancing the specific DNA-binding ability of Msx2.  Other proteins containing this domain include the human pias family (protein inhibitor of activated STAT protein). The name MIZ is derived from M sx- i nteracting- z inc finger. The crystal structure of S. cerevisiae sumo e3 ligase siz1 containing this domain has been solved.	ZMIZ		hgnc.genegroup:26	
851	Piwi-interacting RNA clusters	Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) is the largest class of small non-coding RNA molecules expressed in animal cells.   piRNAs form RNA-protein complexes through interactions with piwi proteins. These piRNA complexes have been linked to both epigenetic and post-transcriptional gene silencing of retrotransposons and other genetic elements in germ line cells, particularly those in spermatogenesis.  They are distinct from microRNA (miRNA) in size (26-31 nt rather than 21-24 nt), lack of sequence conservation, and increased complexity.   It remains unclear how piRNAs are generated, but potential methods have been suggested, and it is certain their biogenesis pathway is distinct from miRNA and siRNA, while rasiRNAs are a piRNA subspecies. 	PIRC		hgnc.genegroup:475	
852	Vault RNAs	Many eukaryotic cells contain large ribonucleoprotein particles in the cytoplasm known as vaults.  The vault complex comprises the major vault protein (MVP), two minor vault proteins (VPARP [PARP4] and TEP1), and a variety of small untranslated RNA molecules. Given the association with the nuclear membrane and the location within the cell, vaults are thought to play roles in intracellular and nucleocytoplasmic transport processes.  Also, given that the structure and protein composition are highly conserved among species, it is believed that the roles vault plays are integral to eukaryotic function.	VTRNA		hgnc.genegroup:475

857	Potassium calcium-activated channel subfamily M regulatory beta subunits	BK channels [potassium large conductance calcium activated channels] have a tetrameric structure. Each monomer of the channel-forming alpha subunit is the product of the KCNMA1 gene. Modulatory beta subunits (encoded by KCNMB1, KCNMB2, KCNMB3, or KCNMB4) can associate with the tetrametic channel.	KCNMB		so:0005855	
858	Potassium voltage-gated channel regulatory subunits	Beta subunits are auxiliary proteins that associate with alpha subunits, sometimes in a alpha4beta4 stoichiometry.

ZMYM2 is also involved in disease. In myeloproliferative disorders it is fused to FGF receptor 1 (<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9576949/'>PMID: 9576949</a>); in atypical myeloproliferative disorders it is rearranged (<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9694738/'>PMID: 9694738</a>.)

862	Cytochrome P450s	Cytochromes P450 (CYPs) belong to the superfamily of proteins containing a heme cofactor and, therefore, are hemoproteins. CYPs use a variety of small and large molecules as substrates in enzymatic reactions. They are, in general, the terminal oxidase enzymes in electron transfer chains, broadly categorized as P450-containing systems. The term P450 is derived from the spectrophotometric peak at the wavelength of the absorption maximum of the enzyme (450 nm) when it is in the reduced state and complexed with CO. CYP enzymes have been identified in all domains of life - animals, plants, fungi, protists, bacteria, archaea, and even in viruses.  However, the enzymes have not been found in E. coli.   More than 21,000 distinct CYP proteins are known.  	CYP		so:0005855	
863	EF-hand domain containing	The EF hand is a helix-loop-helix structural domain or motif found in a large family of calcium-binding proteins. The EF-hand motif contains a helix-loop-helix topology, much like the spread thumb and forefinger of the human hand, in which the Ca 2+ ions are coordinated by ligands within the loop. The motif takes its name from traditional nomenclature used in describing the protein parvalbumin, which contains three such motifs and is probably involved in muscle relaxation via its calcium-binding activity. The EF-hand consists of two alpha helices linked by a short loop region (usually about 12 amino acids ) that usually binds calcium ions.			so:0005855	
864	Histones	In biology, histones are highly alkaline proteins found in eukaryotic cell nuclei that package and order the DNA into structural units called nucleosomes.   They are the chief protein components of chromatin, acting as spools around which DNA winds, and play a role in gene regulation. Without histones, the unwound DNA in chromosomes would be very long (a length to width ratio of more than 10 million to 1 in human DNA). For example, each human cell has about 1.8 meters of DNA, (~6 ft) but wound on the histones it has about 90 micrometers (0.09�mm) of chromatin, which, when duplicated and condensed during mitosis, result in about 120 micrometers of chromosomes. 			so:0005855

868	Glycine receptors	The glycine receptor, or GlyR, is the receptor for the amino acid neurotransmitter glycine. GlyR is an ionotropic receptor that produces its effects through chloride current. It is one of the most widely distributed inhibitory receptors in the central nervous system and has important roles in a variety of physiological processes, especially in mediating inhibitory neurotransmission in the spinal cord and brainstem.	GLRA, GLRB		hgnc.genegroup:161	
87	Zinc fingers MYND-type	In molecular biology the MYND-type zinc finger domain is a conserved protein domain. The MYND domain (myeloid, Nervy, and DEAF-1) is present in a large group of proteins that includes RP-8 (PDCD2), Nervy, and predicted proteins from Drosophila, mammals, Caenorhabditis elegans, yeast, and plants.    The MYND domain consists of a cluster of cysteine and histidine residues, arranged with an invariant spacing to form a potential zinc-binding motif.  Mutating conserved cysteine residues in the DEAF-1 MYND domain does not abolish DNA binding, which suggests that the MYND domain might be involved in protein-protein interactions.

870	Minor histocompatibility antigens	Minor histocompatibility antigens (a.k.a. MHA) are receptors on the cellular surface of donated organs that are known to give an immunological response in some organ transplants.  They cause problems of rejection less frequently than those of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Minor histocompatibility antigens are due to normal proteins that are in themselves polymorphic in a given population. Even when a transplant donor and recipient are identical with respect to their major histocompatibility complex genes, the amino acid differences in minor proteins can cause the grafted tissue to be slowly rejected.			so:0005855

88	PHD finger proteins	The PHD finger was discovered in 1993 as a Cys 4 -His-Cys 3 motif in the plant homeodomain (hence PHD) proteins HAT3.1 in Arabidopsis thaliana and maize ZmHox1a. The PHD finger motif resembles the metal binding RING domain (Cys 3 -His-Cys 4 ) and FYVE domain. It occurs as a single finger, but often in clusters of two or three, and it also occurs together with other domains, such as the chromodomain and the bromodomain.	PHF		hgnc.genegroup:26

Ran is an evolutionary conserved member of the Ras superfamily that regulates all receptor-mediated transport between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Ran binding protein 2 (RanBP2) is a 358kDa nucleoporin located on the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear pore complex which plays a role in nuclear protein import (<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12019565/'>PMID: 12019565</a>). RanBP2 contains multiple zinc fingers which mediate binding to RanGDP (<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10318915/'>PMID: 10318915</a>).	ZRANB		hgnc.genegroup:26	
890	Selenoproteins	In molecular biology a selenoprotein is any protein that includes a selenocysteine (Se-Cys) amino acid residue. Among functionally characterized selenoproteins are five glutathione peroxidases (GPX) and three thioredoxin reductases, (TrxR/TXNRD) which both contain only one Se-Cys.  Selenoprotein P is the most common selenoprotein found in the plasma. It is unusual because in humans it contains 10 Se-Cys residues, which are split into two domains, a longer N-terminal domain that contains 1 Se-Cys, and a shorter C-terminal domain that contains 9 Se-Cys. The longer N-terminal domain is likely an enzymatic domain, and the shorter C-terminal domain is likely a means of safely transporting the very reactive selenium atom throughout the body.

891	M10 matrix metallopeptidases	Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are zinc -dependent endopeptidases; other family members are adamalysins, serralysins, and astacins. The MMPs belong to a larger family of proteases known as the metzincin superfamily. Collectively, these enzymes are capable of degrading all kinds of extracellular matrix proteins, but also can process a number of bioactive molecules. They are known to be involved in the cleavage of cell surface receptors, the release of apoptotic ligands (such as the FAS ligand ), and chemokine dispersion), differentiation, angiogenesis, apoptosis, and host defense. They were first described in vertebrates (1962),  including humans, but have since been found in invertebrates and plants. They are distinguished from other endopeptidases by their dependence on metal ions as cofactors, their ability to degrade extracellular matrix, and their specific evolutionary DNA sequence.	MMP		hgnc.genegroup:901	
892	Tissue inhibitor of metallopeptidases	The matrix metalloproteinases are inhibited by specific endogenous tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), which comprise a family of four protease inhibitors: TIMP1, TIMP2, TIMP3 and TIMP4.  Overall, all MMPs are inhibited by TIMPs once they are activated but the gelatinases (MMP-2 and MMP- ) can form complexes with TIMPs when the enzymes are in the latent form. The complex of latent MMP-2 (pro-MMP-2)with TIMP-2 serves to facilitate the activation of pro-MMP-2 at the cell surface by MT1-MMP ( MMP-14 ), a membrane-anchored MMP. The role of the pro-MMP-9/TIMP-1 complex is still unknown.	TIMP		so:0005855	
894	Astacins	In molecular biology, the astacins are a family of metallopeptidases. These metallopeptidases belong to the MEROPS peptidase family M12, subfamily M12A (astacin family, clan MA(M)). The protein fold of the peptidase domain for members of this family resembles that of thermolysin, the type example for clan MA, and the predicted active site residues for members of this family and thermolysin occur in the motif HEXXH.  The astacin family of metalloendopeptidases (EC 3.4.24.21) encompasses a range of proteins found in hydra to humans, in mature and developmental systems.  Their functions include activation of growth factors, degradation of polypeptides, and processing of extracellular proteins.  The proteins are synthesised with N-terminal signal and pro-enzyme sequences, and many contain multiple domains C-terminal to the protease domain. They are either secreted from cells, or are associated with the plasma membrane. The astacin molecule adopts a kidney shape, with a deep active-site cleft between its N- and C-terminal domains.  The zinc ion, which lies at the bottom of the cleft, exhibits a unique penta-coordinated mode of binding, involving 3 histidine residues, a tyrosine and a water molecule (which is also bound to the carboxylate side chain of Glu93).  The N-terminal domain comprises 2 alpha-helices and a 5-stranded beta-sheet. The overall topology of this domain is shared by the archetypal zinc-endopeptidase thermolysin. Astacin protease domains also share common features with serralysins, matrix metalloendopeptidases, and snake venom proteases; they cleave peptide bonds in polypeptides such as insulin B chain and bradykinin, and in proteins such as casein and gelatin; and they have arylamidase activity. 			hgnc.genegroup:901

It is also found in the related protein MEX (MEKK1-related protein X), a testis-expressed protein that acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase through the action of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes in the proteasome degradation pathway; the SWIM domain is critical for MEX ubiquitination (<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16522193/'>PMID: 16522193</a>).

904	Membrane associated guanylate kinases	The membrane-associated guanylate kinases (MAGUK) are a superfamily of proteins.  The MAGUKs are defined by their inclusion of PDZ, SH3 and GUK domains, although many of them also contain regions homologous of CaMKII, WW and L27 domains.  The GUK domain that they have is structurally very similar to that of the guanylate kinases, however it is known to be catalytically inactive as the P-Loop which binds ATP is absent. It is thought that the MAGUKs have subfunctionalized the GUK domain for their own purposes, primarily based on its ability to form protein-protein interactions with cytoskeleton proteins, microtubule / actin based machinery and molecules involved in signal transduction. The PDZ domain which are contained in the MAGUKs in varying numbers. PDZ domains are short peptide binding sequences commonly found at the C-terminus of interacting proteins. Copies within each of the family members often have different binding partners, due to amino acid differences between the copies. The SH3 domain is again a protein-protein interaction domain. Its family generally bind to PXXP sites, but in MAGUKs it is known to bind to other sites as well. One of the most well known features is that it can form an intramolecular bond with the GUK domain, creating what is known as a GUK-SH3 'closed' state.			so:0005855

These proteins have peptidyl prolyl isomerase activity, which catalyzes the isomerization of peptide bonds from trans form to cis form at proline residues and facilitates protein folding. Cyclophilin A is a cytosolic and highly abundant protein. The protein belongs to a family of isozymes, including cyclophilins B and C, and natural killer cell cyclophilin-related protein.    Major isoforms have been found throughout the cell, including the ER, and some are even secreted.	PPI		hgnc.genegroup:921

These domains contain 4-6 Cys residues that participate in zinc binding (plus additional Ser/His residues), including a Cys-X2-Cys motif found in other zinc finger domains. These zinc fingers are thought to be involved in protein-protein interactions. The structure of the ZZ domain shows that it belongs to the family of cross-brace zinc finger motifs that include the PHD, RING, and FYVE domains.	ZZZ		hgnc.genegroup:26

921	Immunophilins	In molecular biology, immunophilins are endogenous cytosolic peptidyl-prolyl isomerases that interconvert  between the cis and trans positions. Immunophilins are targeted by immunosuppressive drugs such as Sirolimus (earlier rapamycin), cyclosporine, and tacrolimus. For these drugs in particular, known immunophilins such as cyclophilin catalyze the cis-trans isomerization of peptide bonds, particularly X-Pro peptide bonds. This isomerase activity can be inhibited by immunosuppressive drugs.			hgnc.genegroup:922	
922	Peptidylprolyl isomerases	Prolyl isomerase (also known as peptidylprolyl isomerase or PPIase ) is an enzyme ( EC 5.2.1.8 ) found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes that interconverts the cis and trans isomers of peptide bonds with the amino acid proline.  Proline has an unusually conformationally restrained peptide bond due to its cyclic structure with its side chain bonded to its secondary amine nitrogen. Most amino acids have a strong energetic preference for the trans peptide bond conformation due to steric hindrance, but proline's unusual structure stabilizes the cis form so that both isomers are populated under biologically relevant conditions. Proteins with prolyl isomerase activity include cyclophilin, FKBPs, and parvulin, although larger proteins can also contain prolyl isomerase domains.			so:0005855

926	Rhomboid family	The rhomboid proteases are a family of enzymes that exist in almost all species. They are proteases : they cut the polypeptide chain of other proteins. This proteolytic cleavage is irreversible in cells, and an important type of cellular regulation. Although proteases are one of the earliest and best studied class of enzyme, rhomboids belong to a much more recently discovered type: the intramembrane proteases. What is unique about intramembrane proteases is that their active sites are buried in the lipid bilayer of cell membranes, and they cleave other transmembrane proteins within their transmembrane domains.  About 30% of all proteins have transmembrane domains, and their regulated processing often has major biological consequences. Accordingly, rhomboids regulate many important cellular processes, and may be involved in a wide range of human diseases.	RHB		so:0005855

929	Actins	Actins are globular multi-functional proteins that form microfilaments. An actin protein's mass is roughly 42- kDa and they are the monomeric subunit of two types of filaments in cells: microfilaments, one of the three major components of the cytoskeleton, and thin filaments, part of the contractile apparatus in muscle cells. They can be present as either a free monomer called G-actin (globular) or as part of a linear polymer microfilament called F-actin (filamentous) both of which are essential for such important cellular functions as the mobility and contraction of cells during cell division.  Actins participate in many important cellular processes, including muscle contraction, cell motility, cell division and cytokinesis, vesicle and organelle movement, cell signaling, and the establishment and maintenance of cell junctions and cell shape. Many of these processes are mediated by extensive and intimate interactions of actin with cellular membranes.  In vertebrates, three main groups of actin isoforms, alpha, beta, and gamma have been identified. The alpha actins, found in muscle tissues, are a major constituent of the contractile apparatus. The beta and gamma actins coexist in most cell types as components of the cytoskeleton, and as mediators of internal cell motility. 	ACT		so:0005855

932	COP9 signalosome 	COP9 (Constitutive photomorphogenesis 9) signalosome (CSN) is a protein complex with isopeptidase activity. It catalyses the hydrolysis of NEDD8 protein from the cullin subunit of Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRL). Therefore, it is responsible for CRL deneddylation â€“ at the same time, it is able to bind denedyllated cullin-RING complex and retain them in deactivated form. COP9 signalosome thus serves as a sole deactivator of CRLs.  It was found in all eukaryotic organisms including human; it was first discovered in plants.   Human COP9 signalosome (total size ~350 kDa ) consists of 8 subunits - CSN1/COPS1, CSN2/COPS2, CSN3/COPS3, CSN4/COPS4, CSN5/COPS5, CSN6/COPS6, CSN7/COPS7A & COPS7B and CSN8/COPS8. All are essential for full function of the complex and mutation in some of them is lethal in mice. 	COPS		so:0005855	
933	G protein-coupled bile acid receptor	The G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1 (GPBAR1) also known G-protein coupled receptor 19 (GPCR19), membrane-type receptor for bile acids (M-BAR) or TGR5, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the GPBAR1 gene. 	GPBAR		hgnc.genegroup:140

937	Histone deacetylase superfamily	Histone deacetylases (EC 3.5.1.98, HDAC) are a class of enzymes that remove acetyl groups (O=C-CH3) from an epsilon-N-acetyl lysine amino acid on a histone, allowing the histones to wrap the DNA more tightly. This is important because DNA is wrapped around histones, and DNA expression is regulated by acetylation and de-acetylation. Its action is opposite to that of histone acetyltransferase. HDAC proteins are now also called lysine deacetylases (KDAC), to describe their function rather than their target, which also includes non-histone proteins. 	HDAC, SIRT		so:0005855	
938	Sirtuins	Sirtuin or Sir2 proteins are a class of proteins that possess either mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase, or deacylase activity, including deacetylase, desuccinylase, demalonylase, demyristoylase and depalmitoylase activity.  Sirtuins regulate important biological pathways in bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. The name Sir2 comes from the yeast gene 'silent mating-type information regulation 2 ',  the gene responsible for cellular regulation in yeast. The term sirtuins is derived from the word 'sir-two-ins'. Sirtuins have been implicated in influencing a wide range of cellular processes like aging, transcription, apoptosis, inflammation  and stress resistance, as well as energy efficiency and alertness during low-calorie situations.  Sirtuins can also control circadian clocks and mitochondrial biogenesis. Yeast Sir2 and some, but not all, sirtuins are protein deacetylases. Unlike other known protein deacetylases, which simply hydrolyze acetyl - lysine residues, the sirtuin-mediated deacetylation reaction couples lysine deacetylation to NAD hydrolysis. This hydrolysis yields O-acetyl-ADP- ribose, the deacetylated substrate and nicotinamide, itself an inhibitor of sirtuin activity. The dependence of sirtuins on NAD links their enzymatic activity directly to the energy status of the cell via the cellular NAD:NADH ratio, the absolute levels of NAD, NADH or nicotinamide or a combination of these variables.

939	Plakins	The plakins are a family of cytolinkers characterized by a multimodular structure that enables them to function as versatile cross-linkers of the cytoskeleton. They connect the microfilament, microtubule (MT), and intermediate filament (IF) systems with each other and with junctional complexes in organelle and plasma membranes, thereby contributing to cell shape and polarity. They also act as scaffolds and adaptors for signaling proteins that modulate cytoskeletal dynamics or cell migration, differentiation, and stress responses.			so:0005855	
94	Zinc fingers PARP-type	The PARP-type zinc finger domains seem to bind specifically to single-stranded DNA and to act as a DNA nick sensor. DNA ligase III (<a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7760816/'>PMID: 7760816</a>) contains, in its N-terminal section, a single copy of a zinc finger highly similar to those of PARP.			hgnc.genegroup:26	
940	Hemoglobin subunits	Hemoglobin; also spelled haemoglobin and abbreviated Hb or Hgb, is the iron-containing oxygen-transport metalloprotein in the red blood cells of all vertebrates (with the exception of the fish family Channichthyidae ) as well as the tissues of some invertebrates. Hemoglobin in the blood carries oxygen from the respiratory organs (lungs or gills) to the rest of the body (i.e. the tissues). There it releases the oxygen to permit aerobic respiration to provide energy to power the functions of the organism in the process called metabolism. 	HB		so:0005855

945	Selectins	The selectins (cluster of differentiation 62 or CD62) are a family of cell adhesion molecules (or CAMs). All selectins are single-chain transmembrane glycoproteins that share similar properties to C-type lectins due to a related amino terminus and calcium-dependent binding.  Selectins bind to sugar moieties and so are considered to be a type of lectin, cell adhesion proteins that bind sugar polymers. 	SEL		so:0005855	
946	ENAH/VASPs	ENAH/VASPs are a family of closely related proteins involved in cell motility in vertebrate and invertebrate animals. ENAH/VASPs are modular proteins that are involved in actin polymerization, as well as interaction with other proteins. Within the cell, ENAH/VASP proteins are found at the leading edge of Lamellipodia and at the tips of filopodia. Ena, the founding member of the family was discovered in a Drosophila genetic screen for mutations that act as dominant suppressors of the abl non receptor tyrosine kinase. Invertebrate animals have one Ena homologue, whereas human and other mammals have three: ENAH, VASP and EVL.			so:0005855

948	Toll like receptors	Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a class of proteins that play a key role in the innate immune system. They are single, membrane-spanning, non-catalytic receptors usually expressed in sentinel cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells, that recognize structurally conserved molecules derived from microbes. Once these microbes have breached physical barriers such as the skin or intestinal tract mucosa, they are recognized by TLRs, which activate immune cell responses. The TLRs include TLR1, TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9, TLR10, TLR11, TLR12, and TLR13, though the latter 3 are not found in human. They received their name from their similarity to the protein coded by the toll gene identified in Drosophila in 1985 by Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard.  The researchers were so surprised that they spontaneously shouted out in German, ' Das ist ja toll! ' which translates as 'That's great!' 	TLR		hgnc.genegroup:1296	
949	Tektins	Tektins are cytoskeletal proteins found in cilia and flagella as structural components of outer doublet microtubules. They are also present in centrioles and basal bodies. They are polymeric in nature, and form filaments. They include TEKT1, TEKT2, TEKT3, TEKT4, TEKT5.	TEKT		so:0005855

953	Peroxiredoxins	Peroxiredoxins (Prxs, EC 1.11.1.15 ) are a ubiquitous family of antioxidant enzymes that also control cytokine -induced peroxide levels and thereby mediate signal transduction in mammalian cells.  The physiological importance of peroxiredoxins is illustrated by their relative abundance (one of the most abundant proteins in erythrocytes after hemoglobin is peroxiredoxin 2).	PRDX		so:0005855	
954	Phospholipid scramblases	Scramblase is a protein responsible for the translocation of phospholipids between the two monolayers of a lipid bilayer of a cell membrane.    In humans, phospholipid scramblases (PLSCRs) constitute a family of five homologous proteins that are named as PLSCR1-PLSCR5. Scramblases are not members of the general family of transmembrane lipid transporters known as flippases. Scramblases are distinct from flippases and floppases. In fact, scramblases, flippases and floppases are three different types of enzymatic groups of phospholipid transportation enzymes.  The inner-leaflet facing the inside of the cell contains negatively charged amino-phospholipids and phosphatidylethanolamine. The outer-leaflet, facing the outside environment, contains phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin. Scramblase is an enzyme, present in the cell membrane, that can transport (scramble ) the negatively charged phospholipids from the inner-leaflet to the outer-leaflet, and vice versa.

956	Prefoldin subunits	Prefoldin is a family of proteins used in protein folding complexes. It is classified as a heterohexameric molecular chaperone in both archaea and eukarya, including humans. A prefoldin molecule works as a transfer protein in conjunction with a molecule of chaperonin to form a chaperone complex and correctly fold other nascent proteins. One of prefoldin's main uses in eukarya is the formation of molecules of actin for use in the eukaryotic cytoskeleton.	PFDN		so:0005855	
957	Peroxins	Peroxin (or peroxisomal/peroxisome biogenesis factor ) is a protein found in peroxisomes. Deficiencies are associated with several peroxisomal disorders. Numerous peroxin proteins serve several functions including the recognition of cytoplasmic proteins that contain peroxisomal targeting signals (PTS) that tag them for transport by peroxisomal proteins to the peroxisome.

959	Caspase recruitment domain containing	Caspase recruitment domains, or Caspase activation and recruitment domains ( CARDs ), are interaction motifs found in a wide array of proteins, typically those involved in processes relating to inflammation and apoptosis. These domains mediate the formation of larger protein complexes via direct interactions between individual CARDs. CARD domains are found on a strikingly wide range of proteins, including helicases, kinases, mitochondrial proteins, caspases, and other cytoplasmic factors.	CARD		so:0005855	
96	Zinc fingers CW-type	These genes encode proteins with a CW-type zinc finger motif, named for its conserved cysteine and tryptophan residues. It is predicted to be a highly specialised mononuclear four-cysteine (C4) zinc finger that plays a role in DNA binding and/or promoting protein-protein interactions in complicated eukaryotic processes including chromatin methylation status and early embryonic development. The domain is found exclusively in vertebrates, vertebrate-infecting parasites and higher plants.	ZCW		hgnc.genegroup:26	
960	Origin recognition complex 	In molecular biology, ORC or origin recognition complex is a multi-subunit DNA binding complex (6 subunits) that binds in all eukaryotes in an ATP-dependent manner to origins of replication. The subunits of this complex are encoded by the ORC1, ORC2, ORC3, ORC4, ORC5 and ORC6 genes. ORC is a central component for eukaryotic DNA replication, and binds chromatin at replication origins throughout the cell cycle. ORC directs DNA replication throughout the genome and is required for its initiation. ORC bound at replication origins serves as the foundation for assembly of the pre-replication complex (pre-RC), which includes Cdc6, Tah11 (aka Cdt1), and the Mcm2 - Mcm7 complex. Pre-RC assembly during G1 is required for replication licensing of chromosomes prior to DNA synthesis during S phase. Cell cycle -regulated phosphorylation of Orc2, Orc6, Cdc6, and MCM by the cyclin -dependent protein kinase Cdc28 regulates initiation of DNA replication, including blocking reinitiation in G2 / M phase.     In yeast, ORC also plays a role in the establishment of silencing at the mating-type loci Hidden MAT Left (HML) and Hidden MAT Right (HMR). ORC participates in the assembly of transcriptionally silent chromatin at HML and HMR by recruiting the Sir1 silencing protein to the HML and HMR silencers. Both Orc1 and Orc5 bind ATP, though only Orc1 has ATPase activity.  The binding of ATP by Orc1 is required for ORC binding to DNA and is essential for cell viability.  The ATPase activity of Orc1 is involved in formation of the pre-RC. ATP binding by Orc5 is crucial for the stability of ORC as a whole. Only the Orc1-5 subunits are required for origin binding; Orc6 is essential for maintenance of pre-RCs once formed.  Interactions within ORC suggest that Orc2-3-6 may form a core complex.

971	Histatins and statherin	Histatins are proteins found in saliva.  They are antimicrobial and antifungal proteins, and have been found to play a role in wound-closure.  A significant source of histatins is found in the serous fluid secreted by Ebner's glands, salivary glands at the back of the tongue. Here they offer some early defense against incoming microbes. The three major histatins are 1, 3, and 5. Histatin 2 is a degradation product of histatin 1, and all other histatins are degradation products of histatin 3. Therefore there are only two genes, HTN1 and HTN3. Histatins also precipitate tannins from solution - thus preventing alimentary adsorption. 	HTN		so:0005855	
972	Proline rich proteins 	Proline-rich proteins (PRPs) is a class of intrinsically unstructured proteins  (IUP) containing several repeats of a short proline-rich sequence. Many tannin -consuming animals secrete a tannin-binding protein ( mucin ) in their saliva. Tannin-binding capacity of salivary mucin is directly related to its proline content. Advantages in using salivary proline-rich proteins (PRPs) to inactivate tannins are: PRPs inactivate tannins to a greater extent than do dietary proteins; this results in reduced fecal nitrogen losses, PRPs contain non specific nitrogen and nonessential amino acids; this makes them more convenient for an animal to exploit rather than using up valuable dietary protein.  An example of this class of protein is IB5, a human parotid salivary protein known to bind with polyphenols (binding responsible for the astringency mouth feel).	PRB, PRH		so:0005855	
973	Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin family	Proprotein convertases are a family of proteins that activate other proteins. Many proteins are inactive when they are first synthesized, because they contain chains of amino acids that block their activity. Proprotein convertases remove those chains and activate the protein. The prototypical proprotein convertase is furin.  Proprotein convertases have medical significance, because they are involved in many important biological processes, such as cholesterol synthesis.  Compounds called proprotein convertase inhibitors can block their action, and block the target proteins from becoming active. Many proprotein convertases, especially furin and PACE4, are involved in pathological processes such as viral infection, inflammation, hypercholesterolemia, and cancer, and have been postulated as therapeutic targets for some of these diseases. 	PCSK		so:0005855	
974	Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family	Acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (ACADs) are a class of enzymes that function to catalyze the initial step in each cycle of fatty acid Î²-oxidation in the mitochondria of cells. Their action results in the introduction of a trans double-bond between C2 (Î±) and C3 (Î²) of the acyl-CoA thioester substrate.  Flavin adenine dinucleotide ( FAD ) is a required co-factor in addition to the presence of an active site glutamate in order for the enzyme to function. ACADs can be categorized into three distinct groups based on their specificity for short-, medium-, or long-chain fatty acid acyl-CoA substrates. While different dehydrogenases target fatty acids of varying chain length, all types of ACADs are mechanistically similar. Differences in the enzyme occur based on the location of the active site along the amino acid sequence.  ACADs are an important class of enzymes in mammalian cells because of their role in metabolizing fatty acids present in ingested food materials. This enzyme's action represents the first step in fatty acid metabolism (the process of breaking long chains of fatty acids into acetyl CoA molecules). Deficiencies in these enzymes are linked to genetic disorders involving fatty acid oxidation (i.e. metabolic disorders).  ACAD enzymes have been identified in animals (of which there are 9 major eukaryotic classes), as well as plants,  nematodes,  fungi,  and bacteria.  Five of these nine classes are involved in fatty acid Î²-oxidation (SCAD, MCAD, LCAD, VLCAD, and VLCAD2), and the other four are involved in branched chain amino acid metabolism (i3VD, i2VD, GD, and iBD). Most acyl-CoA dehydrogenases are Î± 4 homotetramers, and in two cases (for very long chain fatty acid substrates) they are Î± 2 homodimers. An additional class of acyl-CoA dehydrogenase was discovered that catalyzes Î±,Î²-unsaturation reactions with steroid-CoA thioesters in certain types of bacteria.   This class of ACAD was demonstrated to form Î± 2 Î² 2 heterotetramers, rather than the usual Î± 4 homotetramer, a protein architecture that evolved in order to accommodate a much larger steroid-CoA substrate.   ACADs are classified as EC 1.3.99.3.	ACAD		so:0005855	
975	Calpains	A calpain (EC 3.4.22.52, EC 3.4.22.53) is a protein belonging to the family of calcium -dependent, non- lysosomal cysteine proteases ( proteolytic enzymes ) expressed ubiquitously in mammals and many other organisms. Calpains constitute the C2 family of protease clan CA in the MEROPS database. The calpain proteolytic system includes the calpain proteases, the small regulatory subunit CAPNS1, also known as CAPN4, and the endogenous calpain-specific inhibitor, calpastatin.	CAPN		so:0005855
