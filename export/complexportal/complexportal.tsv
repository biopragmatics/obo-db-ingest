CPX-1	SMAD2-SMAD3-SMAD4 complex	A transcription factor complex which binds to the promoters of target genes and recruits co-activators and histone acetyltransferases, such as p300, CBP and P300/CBP-associated factor, facilitating transcription. In response to TGF-beta/activin-family protein binding, TGF-beta type II receptors phosphorylate TGF-beta type I receptors (ALK4, 5 and 7) which in turn phosphorylates SMAD2 on two Ser-465 and Ser-467, and SMAD3 on Ser-423 and Ser-425. This enables binding to SMAD4 to form heteromeric SMAD complexes that enter the nucleus to initiate gene transcription. Because of their relatively low DNA-binding affinity, SMAD complexes interact with a wide variety of DNA-binding proteins. Crosstalk with other signalling pathways and interaction with other DNA-binding cofactors define the specific binding patterns of SMADs; in addition, interaction with coactivators/corepressors modulates their transcriptional activity.

CPX-10041	Interleukin-18 receptor-ligand complex	Proinflammatory cytokine-receptor complex which strongly augments IFNG production (P01579) in synergy with IL12 (CPX-381) from T helper-1 and natural killer cells. Synthesised as a biological inactive precursor upon exposure to intracellular pathogens, proIL18 is stored in the cytoplasm until cleavage by inflammasome-mediated CASP1 (P29466), CASP4 (P49662) or CASP5 (P51878), when it is secreted extracellularly. Mature IL18 initiates signalling by binding IL18R1 and IL18RAP in a step-wise fashion at the immunocyte plasma membrane. Complex formation and heterodimerization of the receptors' Toll/IL-1 receptor domains triggers recruitment of MyD88(Q99836), which initiates downstream signalling through phosphorylation of IRAKs,TRAF6 (Q9Y4K3), and NFKB (P19838) activation. IL18 is tightly regulated at the gene level by CASP1 and at the protein level by IL18BP (O95998), and over-expression of IL18 is associated with several autoimmune diseases including, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's diseases and systemic lupus erythematosus.

CPX-1005	Cascade complex	CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat), is an adaptive immune system that provides protection against mobile genetic elements (viruses, transposable elements and conjugative plasmids). The system memorizes previous infections by integrating short sequences of invading genomes (spacers) into the CRISPR locus. The spacers, interspaced with repeats, are expressed as small guide CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) that are employed by Cas proteins to target invaders sequence-specifically upon a reoccurring infection. Upon viral invasion, the Cascade complex binds double-stranded DNA exhibiting sequence complementary to the crRNA spacer sequence, while displacing the non-target strand to form an R-loop, and then recruits the nuclease Cas3/ygcB (P38036) for target degradation.

CPX-1006	Calcineurin-Calmodulin-AKAP5 complex, beta-R1 variant	Calcium-dependent, calmodulin-stimulated protein phosphatase calcineurin in complex with plasma-membrane anchor protein Akap5. Calcineurin is important for cardiac development and pathophysiology, for nervous-system development and for some of the plastic changes in neurons that are believed to underlie learning and memory. Akap5 recruits calcineurin to the vicinity of L-type Ca2+ channels for their activation by elevated Ca2+ entering the cell. Akap5 balances the opposing effects of calcineurin and protein kinase A (PKA) (P05132) on neuronal voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels and coordinates the activities of calcineurin, PKA and PKC on a number of other channels and receptors. Despite its atypical PxIxIT calcineurin-recognition motif that confers stronger binding affinity by calcineurin than other substrates it allows for effective disengagement of calcineurin to couple channel activation with downstream signaling events. The calcineurin-Akap5 complex has been shown to promote NFAT signaling.

CPX-10081	DASH complex	Heterodecameric component of the kinetochore necessary for accurate chromosome segregation, supporting the dynamic attachment of mitotic chromosomes to the ends of shortening spindle microtubules. DASH forms closed rings around microtubules with a large gap between the DASH ring and the microtubule cylinder. A DASH-microtubule interface is believed to form, in which extensions from DASH rings reach across a gap between the ring and the microtubule and dock on the microtubule wall. DASH rings spontaneously oligomerize in the presence of microtubules of the mitotic spindle. DASH rings are processivity factors that allow kinetochores to translate along a single microtubule without dissociating. Each DASH ring may contain from 16-30 heterodecamers. The NDC80 complex (CPX-549) can simultaneously bind and bridge across two DASH complex rings through a tripartite interaction. This ensures a consistent spacing between rings. The complex may also may serve as a link between the kinetochore and the mitotic spindle. DASH is assembled and localized onto kinetochores specifically in mitosis.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:284812

CPX-101	Titin-Telethonin complex	The complex between the N-terminus of the giant sarcomeric filament protein titin with the Z-disk ligand, telethonin is believed to anchor titin in the Z-disk of the skeletal and cardiac sarcomere. The extensive interactions between the two proteins indicate that Telethonin provides a 'bridge' that anchors the ends of two different Titin molecules to the Z disk. There is evidence that Telethonin binding to Titin might be essential for the initial assembly, stabilization and functional integrity of the Titin filament and hence important for muscle contraction relaxation in mature myofibrils.

CPX-10221	Interleukin-19 receptor-ligand complex	Cytokine receptor complex that polarizes adaptive immunity to promote an anti-inflammatory phenotype. IL19 binding to its receptor complex, IL20RA-IL20RB initiates downstream signalling mediated by JAK1, Tyk2 and STAT3 (P40763) phosphorylation. IL19 inhibits IFNG (P01579) production by down-regulating antigen presenting capacity and enhancing M2 macrophage polarization to promote T helper 2 (Th2) cell differentiation through IL4 (P05112) and IL13 (P35225) up-regulation and suppression of Th1 and Th17 cell differentiation. The bioactive complex is formed through crosstalk between IL19 cytokine producing immune cells and receptor complex expressing epthelial cells and in particular, vascular cells, in which it is thought to exhibit vasculo-protective effects. IL19 exerts contrasting effects on immunity wherein it exerts anti-inflammatory effects to hamper hyperactivation of innate and acquired immunity in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) but exacerbates disease by a positive feedback loop in the case of asthma.

Complex formation results in the transphosphorylation of JAK1 and TYK2, which in turn leads to the phosphorylation and activation of transcription factors STAT3 which subsequently translocates into the nucleus where it induces the transcription of target genes. Dysregulation of IL20-mediated signalling is implicated in the pathophysiology of psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis. IL20's arteriogenic and angiogenic properties may be important in treating ischemic disease.	IL20-IL20RA-DIRS1 complex|ZCYTO10- IL20RA-IL20RB complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606

Complex formation results in the transphosphorylation of JAK1 and TYK2, which in turn leads to the phosphorylation and activation of transcription factors STAT3 which subsequently translocates into the nucleus where it induces the transcription of target genes. The restricted expression pattern of the receptors which bind IL20 subfamily of cytokines (IL19, IL20, IL22, IL24 and IL26) determines their unique biology and distinguishes them from the larger family of IL10 members. This also underlies their complex role in the pathophysiology of diseases such as IBD, where IL22RA1 and IL22 (Q9GZX6) are implicated but IL20 is not.

CPX-1027	Importin complex, KPNA2 variant	A nuclear import complex that functions as a nuclear import receptor for proteins containing a nuclear localisation signal (NLS). Subunit KPNA2 specifically and directly binds to substrates containing either a simple or bipartite NLS motif. Docking of the importin/substrate complex to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) is mediated by KPNB1. KPNB1 binds to nucleoporin FxFG repeats and the complex is subsequently translocated through the pore by an energy requiring, RAN-dependent mechanism. At the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC, RAN-GTP (P62826) binds to KPNB1, the three components separate and KPNA2 and KPNB1 are re-exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where GTP is hydrolysed. The directionality of nuclear import is thought to be conferred by an asymmetric distribution of the GTP- and GDP-bound forms of RAN between the cytoplasm and nucleus.

CPX-10281	Myddosome core complex	Innate immune signalling platform which transmits inflammatory signals as a result of TLR/IL1R (P14778) activation to promote proinflammatory responses. Myddosome assembly occurs in a stepwise manner in which MyD88 recruits IRAK4, and the intermediary MyD88:IRAK4 complex recruits and binds IRAK1/IRAK2 drawing IRAKs' kinase domains closer, allowing for phosphorylation and activation. IRAK1/IRAK2 subsequently enables binding to TRAF6 (Q9Y4K3), which is vital for recruiting transcription factors in the NFKB and MAPK pathways to elicit expression of proinflammatory cytokines. Myddosome assembly is tightly-regulated by IRAK4 and occurs in a context-specific manner with all components playing substantial roles in scaffolding. Myddosome size, number and assembly speed governs the intensity of the inflammatory response. Myddosome-mediated proinflammatory responses are determined by IRAK4 activity but IRAK4 is also capable of indirectly inhibiting myddosome signalling thereby forming a negative feedback loop. Uncontrolled myddosome activation is linked to cancers caused by gain-of-function mutations.	IRAK:IRAK2:IRAK4:MyD88 complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606

CPX-103	Beta-catenin destruction core complex, Apc-Axin1-Gsk3b variant	Phosphorylates cytoplasmic beta-catenin (Ctnnb1, Q02248) in the absence of WNT-signalling, thus positively controlling its continuous proteasome-mediated degradation. Csnk1a1 phosphorylates Ctnnb1 on Ser-45 and primes successive phosphorylation of Thr-41, Ser-37, and Ser-33 by GSK3. Phosphorylation of Ctnnb1 promotes its subsequent ubiquitination which targets the protein for degradation by the proteasome. Without Wnt, Axin is also phosphorylated by GSK3, and thereby kept in an active, open conformation for beta-catenin binding and degradation. Upon Wnt stimulation, the ternary Wnt-Fz-Lrp6 complex is formed and recruits the scaffold protein Dvl and the beta-catenin destruction complex. As a result, GSK3 is inhibited, Ctnnb1 is not ubiquitinated and accumulates in the nucleus, where it acts as a coactivator for transcription factors of the Tcf/Lef family, leading to activation of Wnt responsive genes.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:10090

The complex also plays a role in double-strand break and nucleotide excision repair mechanisms and in the decatenation of newly replicated sister chromatids, a requirement for proper chromosome segregation during mitosis. The complex is involved in a variety of developmental processes including embryonic cell divisions, larval asymmetric cell divisions, generation of neuroblasts and neurons, muscle differentiation, somatic gonadogenesis, vulval induction, and timing of larval development.

There are three functionally different isoforms of IL22RA2 in humans, the non-functional isoform 1, isoform 2 which has a strong inhibitory effect on IL22 activity and isoform 3, which is abundantly distributed but binds IL22 with an affinity that is 27-fold lower than that of isoform 2.

IL24 is expressed in a variety of immune cells as well as epithelial cells such as keratinocytes and fibroblasts. Elevated levels of IL24 is associated with many pro-inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis and rheumatoid arthiritis but it can also play a protective anti-inflammatory role such as in multiple sclerosis where IL24 deficiency leads to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.

CPX-10316	Interleukin-26 receptor-ligand complex	Receptor-cytokine complex thought to function both as a driver and an effector of inflammation. IL26 binding to its receptor complex induces JAK1/TYK2 signalling leading to activation of STAT1/STAT3. Monomeric and dimeric IL26 are both functional, but are thought to differ in their ability to activate epithelial cells and monocytes, as well as in their binding locations to form the functional receptor-ligand complex. Primarily secreted by pathogenic T helper 1 (Th1), Th17 and CD4+ cells, IL26 activity is restricted by the expression of its receptor IL20R1 to epithelial cells and some myeloid cells. The inability of immune cells to express IL20R1 is thought to lend IL26 to alternative ways (CPX-10317) to mediate its proinflammatory effects in IL20R1-negative cells. IL26 is considered to be a master regulator of inflammation but one that could also be a catalyst for driving chronic inflammatory disorders. In addition to the proinflammatory effects it mediates, IL26 functions as a kinocidin or antimicrobial protein (AMP) with strong antimicrobial and bactericidal effects, particularly on Gram-positive bacteria, through its capacity to form pores in bacterial membranes.

May activate innate and adaptive lymphoid cells, myeloid cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) by allowing DNA to be internalized by pDC, leading to its activation via TLR9 (Q9NR96) or TLR3 (O15455). IL26 binds as a monomer to a conventional heterodimeric receptor (CPX-10316) to exert some potentially pathological effects in inflammatory disorders. IL26 is primarily secreted by pathogenic T helper 1 (Th1), Th17 and CD4+ cells. IL26 is considered to be a master regulator of inflammation but is also a catalyst for driving chronic inflammatory disorders.

At the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC, Ran-GTP (P62826) binds to KPNB1, the three components separate and SNUPN and KPNB1 are re-exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where GTP is hydrolysed. The directionality of nuclear import is thought to be conferred by an asymmetric distribution of the GTP- and GDP-bound forms of Ran between the cytoplasm and nucleus.

CPX-10322	IL33 receptor-ligand complex	Pleiotropic receptor-cytokine complex which acts as an alarmin and is involved in inflammatory and metabolic disease. IL33 binding to IL1RL1 induces a coformational change that allows IL1RL1 to interact with its co-receptor IL1RAP. Receptor heterodimerization results in the juxtaposition of the intracellular TIR domains of both receptors to activate NFKB and MAPK pathways in target cells driving cell survival, proliferation and AREG (P15514) expression by IL1RL1+ cells. IL33 is thought to be negatively regulated upon sequestration by soluble IL1RL1 (CPX-10324). Impaired IL33-IL1R1 signalling is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease.

CPX-10323	54S mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit	Component of the ribosome, the site of protein biosynthesis resulting from translation of messenger RNA (mRNA). Responsible for the catalytic activity of the ribosome, the peptidyltransferase activity required to catalyze peptide bond formation. The mitochondrial ribosome (mitoribosome) is responsible for the synthesis of mitochondrial genome-encoded proteins, including at least some of the essential transmembrane subunits of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The mitoribosomes are tethered to the mitochondrial inner membrane and translation products are cotranslationally integrated into the membrane.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:284812

CPX-10333	IL34-CSF1R complex	Cytokine-receptor complex. IL34 mediates its effects primarily through CSF1R (this complex), with alternative receptors proposed, PTPRZ1 (P23471) and SDC1 (P18827). IL34 binding to CSF1R results in receptor phosphorylation and homodimerization leading to the activation of several pathways including MAP and SRC kinases, the JAK/STAT, RAS and AMPK1 pathways, thus supporting cell growth, survival of monocytes and their differentiation into macrophages. IL34 is expressed in a wide variety of tissues but the highest levels are expressed by neurons and keratinocytes. Predominantly associated with the disease progression of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus as well as, breast and lung cancer, IL34's role in disease progression is disease-dependent with beneficial protective roles in some cancers and Alzheimers disease.

CPX-10334	Interleukin-35 receptor ligand type 1 complex	Inhibitory cytokine-receptor complex that plays a key role in immune regulation by promoting the expansion of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and Bregs, while simultaneously suppressing effector T cells, Th1 cells, Th17 cells and macrophages. IL35 signals through four receptors: IL12RB2 homodimers, IL6ST homodimers, IL12RB2/IL6ST heterodimers (this complex) and IL12RB2/IL27RA (Q6UWB1). Although homodimeric receptors partially mediate IL35's immunosuppressive signalling, maximal function is effected by the IL12RB2-IL6ST heterodimer. IL35 binding to IL12RB2-IL6ST induces immunosuppressive effects on Treg cells mediated through JAK1/JAK2 and STAT1/STAT4. Heterodimerization of the receptor phosphorylated by JAK1 and JAK2 promotes expression of IL12A and EBI3 leading to the generation of Foxp3-negative IL35-producing induced Treg (iTr35) cells, thereby creating a positive feedback loop to induce further iTr35 cell differentiation resulting in infectious tolerance. Suppresses autoimmune diseases by converting resting B- and T-cells into IL10 (P22301) and IL35-producing Breg and Treg cells.

IL35 binding to IL12RB2/IL27RA induces IL12A and EBI3 transcription and the activation of the JAK-STAT pathway through JAK1/JAK2 and STAT1/STAT3 (P42224/P40763). IL35 initiates infectious tolerance, whereby continuous generation of IL35-producing Bregs establishes a positive feedback loop to amplify its immunoregulatory signals.

IL35 binding to IL12RB2 homodimers (this complex) induces IL12A and EBI3 transcription and the activation of the JAK-STAT pathway through JAK2/STAT4 phosphorylation.

Direct repeats flanking a double-stranded break is annealed by RAD52 (P06778) and further stabilized by MSH2-MSH3 which has similar activities on both the leading and lagging strands of replication. MSH2-MSH3 appear to facilitate targeted integration by the two-end invasion pathway while simultaneously inhibiting the single-strand assimilation pathway.

CPX-1037	DNA mismatch repair MutSalpha complex	Mismatch repair complex, involved in the recognition and repair of base-base and small insertion/deletion mismatches that appear as a consequence of DNA polymerase errors during DNA synthesis. The complex is most effective at repairing mismatches on the lagging strand of replication. Binding to a mismatched DNA which can bend, leads to stable association of MSH2 with DNA, inhibition of its ATP activity and formation of ATP-bound MSH2-MSH6 sliding clamps. When MSH6 is bound to mismatched DNA and MSH2 to ATP, the complex can recruit MutLalpha and initiate the repair process.

CPX-104	MAD-MAX transcriptional repressor complex	Transcriptional repressor which recognizes an E box hexanucleotide DNA consensus sequence 5'-CACGTG-3' located within gene promoters. Antagonises transcriptional activation by MYC family members by competing for available MAX to form heterodimers, competiing with other heterodimers for E-box-binding sites, and also potentially directly repressing bound genes. MXD family members contain a short conserved amino acid sequence, which directly interacts with the SIN3A (CPX-3321.CPX-3323) or SIN3B (CPX-3322) histone deacetylase co-repressor complexes which mediate gene silencing.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606

CPX-1041	DASH complex	Heterodecameric component of the kinetochore necessary for accurate chromosome segregation, supporting the dynamic attachment of mitotic chromosomes to the ends of shortening spindle microtubules. DASH forms closed rings around microtubules with a large gap between the DASH ring and the microtubule cylinder. A DASH-microtubule interface is believed to form, in which extensions from DASH rings reach across a gap between the ring and the microtubule and dock on the microtubule wall. DASH rings spontaneously oligomerize in the presence of microtubules of the mitotic spindle. DASH rings are processivity factors that allow kinetochores to translate along a single microtubule without dissociating. Each DASH ring may contain from 16-30 heterodecamers. The NDC80 complex (CPX-548) can simultaneously bind and bridge across two DASH complex rings through a tripartite interaction, each component of which is regulated by IPL1 kinase (P38991). This ensures a consistent spacing between rings. The complex may also may serve as a link between the kinetochore and the mitotic spindle.

CPX-1042	GAL3-GAL80 transcription regulation complex	Acts to relieve the repression of the GAL4 positive regulator of gene expression. The GAL network is a small set of genes that regulates galactose import and metabolism. The transcriptional activator GAL4 activates a set of enzymatic and regulatory genes by binding to their promoter regions. When galactose is the sole carbon source, the galactose-metabolizing enzymes are expressed at 1000 times their level in glucose. In the absence of galactose, GAL4 activity is repressed by forming a complex with the transcriptional repressor GAL80 (CPX-1044). In the presence of galactose and ATP, the GAL3-GAL80 complex forms, removing GAL80 from the GAL4-activation domain, which is then able to recruit the transcriptional machinery. It is also possible a tripartite complex forms (GAL4-GAL80-GAL3), which counterbalances the effect of GAL80 on GAL4 and allows GAL4 to interact with promoters. GAL3 primarily binds with ATP and galactose in the cytoplasm, then moves into the nucleus to interact with GAL80. A paralogous complex, GAL1-GAL80 (CPX-1043) can also form but appears to have lower activity as a transcriptional inducer of GAL genes. It is possible that GAL3-GAL80 may be involved solely in the short-term response to galactose and GAL1-GAL80 is required for continued expression of the GAL genes.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:559292
CPX-1043	GAL1-GAL80 transcription regulation complex	Acts to relieve the repression of the GAL4 positive regulator of gene expression. The GAL network is a small set of genes that regulates galactose import and metabolism. The transcriptional activator GAL4 activates a set of enzymatic and regulatory genes by binding to their promoter regions. When galactose is the sole carbon source, the galactose-metabolizing enzymes are expressed at 1000 times their level in glucose. In the absence of galactose, GAL4 activity is repressed by forming a complex with the transcriptional repressor GAL80 (CPX-1044). In the presence of galactose and ATP, the GAL1-GAL80 complex forms, removing GAL80 from the GAL4-activation domain, which is then able to recruit the transcriptional machinery. It is also possible a tripartite complex forms (GAL4-GAL80-GAL1), which counterbalances the effect of GAL80 on GAL4 and allows GAL4 to interact with promoters. GAL1 primarily binds with ATP and galactose in the cytoplasm, then moves into the nucleus to interact with GAL80. A paralogous complex, GAL3-GAL80 (CPX-1042) can also form and appears to have significantly higher activity as a transcriptional inducer of GAL genes. The importance of GAL1-GAL80 is unclear as it appears that GAL1 is not sufficiently expressed in the absence of galactose to serve as an inducer but other evidence suggests the complex may be required for the continued expression of the GAL genes.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:559292

Plays a pivotal role during nervous system development and in various functions of mature central and peripheral nervous system. Regulates the NFAT signaling cascade by binding to and dephosphorylating NFAT leading to nuclear translocation of this larger complex and increasing the DNA-binding affinity of the NFAT family of transcription factors. Calcineurin also promotes nuclear retention of NFAT by masking nuclear export signals (NES) and preventing NES-dependent nuclear export. Altered calcineurin-NFAT activation can mediate both neuroprotective and neurodegenerative signals and is linked to pathological features of neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntingtons, Parkinsons, and Alzheimers diseases. Modulates Ca2+-dependent inactivation (CDI) of voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels. CDI is initiated by Ca2+ binding to channel-associated calmodulin and subsequent activation of calcineurin, which is targeted to L channels by the A-kinase-anchoring protein AKAP5 (CPX-674).

CPX-1053	Cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor complex	Endonuclease complex required for mRNA 3' end processing to form a defined 3' end of the transcribed RNA. The complex cleaves pre-mRNAs, adds a polyadenylate tail, and triggers transcription termination. The 3' end of mature mRNAs is generated by a site-specific endonucleolytic cleavage of an internal phosphodiester bond of the primary transcript by YSH1. The upstream cleavage product generated is then polyadenylated by PAP1 to form a 50-90 adenosine tail at its 3-prime hydroxyl end, which is required for nuclear export, translation, and stability of mRNA. The downstream cleavage product is rapidly degraded. Cleavage and polyadenylation cycles are regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. Phosphorylation of CPF is inhibitory to polyadenylation therefore dephosphorylation of CPF by GLC7 is required to switch the processing complex to one competent for poly(A) addition.

Phosphorylation of CTNNB1 promotes its subsequent ubiquitination which targets the protein for degradation by the proteasome. Without WNT, Axin is also phosphorylated by GSK3, and thereby kept in an active (‘open’) conformation for beta-catenin binding and degradation. Upon WNT stimulation, the ternary WNT-FZ-LRP6 complex is formed and recruits the scaffold protein DVL and the beta-catenin destruction complex. As a result, GSK3 is inhibited, CTNNB1 is not ubiquitinated and accumulates in the nucleus, where it acts as a coactivator for transcription factors of the TCF/LEF family, leading to activation of WNT responsive genes. GSK3A is normally excluded from the nucleus and appears to only accumulate there, and regulate CTNNB1 levels, following activation of calpain in response to calcium levels.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606
CPX-1070	Amyloid-beta protein 42 complex	Protein complex involved in modulation of signaling and synaptic function in the brain, predominantly in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. May have a role in depressing synaptic activity thus preventing excitotoxicity. Influences synaptic plasticity through various receptors, including NMDAR, mGluR and alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (CPX-236). Mediates dendritic spine loss leading to decreased synapse density, inhibition of long-term potentiation (LTP), enhancement of long-term depression (LTD), excessive calcium influx and mitochondrial impairment. May affect metal ion homeostasis by celating synaptic copper, zinc or iron ions. Oligomers of protein 42 only may have positive neurogenetic effects by activating synaptic protein kinases. Mostly found in the extracellular space with a small proportion occurring as membrane-bound species. Dimers and oligomers of soluble amyloid-beta peptides are the main pathogenic species linked to Alzheimer's disease. Insoluble fibrils and plaques form during the latter stages of the disease. Chaperones, such as alphaB-crystallins or clusterin (P10909), bind to misfolded oligomeric species and form long-lived complexes, thereby preventing both their further growth into fibrils and their dissociation into synaptotoxic dimers. Amyloid-beta peptide may act as transcription factor for its own precursor protein APP and its cleavage enzyme BACE1 (P56817) initiating a positive feedback mechanism that ultimately leads to amyloidogenesis and Alzheimer's disease.

CPX-1071	RecQ helicase-Topo III complex	Required for both the early and late steps of DNA double-strand break (DSB) via dissolution of double Holliday junctions. Early in the repair of a two-ended DSB, the complex contributes to DSB end resection by facilitating the formation of a single-strand 3-prime overhang on which the homologous recombination (HR) factor Rad51 (P25454) filament assembles. The complex has also been implicated in the unwinding of strand invasion after extension of the invading 3-prime end by DNA synthesis to promote DSB repair by synthesis-dependent strand annealing, as well as reversal of strand invasion prior to 3-prime end extension. Through these functions, the complex promotes non-crossover outcomes of HR and regulates HR levels.

DICER then cleaves approximately 22 nucleotides from the 5' end of the stem-loop to form mature double-stranded miRNAs. The duplex miRNA is then loaded onto Argonaute (AGO) proteins which, with the scaffolding proteins TNRC6, form the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC).

Once bound to the pre-mRNA, U2AF2 recruits the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP) to the assembling spliceosome. Phosphorylation of SF1 by UHMK1 (Q8TAS1) enhances SF1-U2AF2 interactions and promotes assembly of the ternary complex of SF1, U2AF2, and the 3-prime splice site.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606
CPX-1075	Ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase 1 complex	Catalyzes the reduction of ribonucleotides to the corresponding deoxyribonucleotides, an essential step in the de novo synthesis of monomeric precursors for DNA replication and repair. The binding of effector dATP alters the active site to select for pyrimidines over purines, whereas effectors dGTP and TTP select for substrates ADP and GDP, respectively.

CPX-1076	mCRD-poly(A)-bridging complex	mRNA-bridging complex that forms between the 3-prime poly(A) tail and the major coding-region determinant of instability (mCRD) domain. Protects mRNA containing an mCRD domain prior to translation by stabilizing the poly(A) tail/PABP complex, thus blocking poly(A) nuclease access to the poly(A) tail. During translation, ribosomal movement up to or across the mCRD displaces or reorganizes the bridging complex, thereby allowing formation of metastable structures which expose the poly(A) tail to nuclease attack. The complex is disrupted by competitive binding of PAIP2 (Q9BPZ3) to PABPC1, thus displacing PAIP1 from PABPC1 and PABPC1 from the poly(A) tail leading to premature deadenylation and mRNA decay.	mCRD-mediated mRNA stability complex|major coding region determinant of instability-mediated mRNA stability complex|major coding region instability determinant-mediated mRNA stability complex|major coding-region determinant of instability - poly(A) tail-bridging complex|major coding-region instability determinant - poly(A) tail-bridging complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606
CPX-1077	Chemotaxis phosphorelay complex CheA-CheY	Plays a role in chemotaxis, the movement toward or away from chemicals. The complex is formed to activate cheY protein that then induces the change of the flagellar rotors from counterclocwise to clockwise rotation. cheA interacts with transmembrane chemoreceptors to generate stimulus signals via autophosphorylion of cheA which then serves as a phosphodonor for cheY. The P-cheY generated by this interaction binds to fliM (P06974), the switch component of the flagellar motor.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:83333

CPX-1079	DinJ-YafQ toxin-antitoxin complex	Type II toxin-antitoxin (TA) system formed by the toxin (yafQ), and the antitoxin (dinJ). TA systems act as effectors of dormancy and persistence, with the toxin causing growth arrest by interfering with a vital cellular process, such as transcription, translation or DNA replication, and the cognate antitoxin neutralizing the toxin activity during normal growth conditions. The toxin yafQ degrades mRNA at adenosine-rich codons, most likely while it is bound to the ribosome. The binding of dinJ occludes the active site of yafQ. Under conditions of stress the antitoxins are selectively degraded by cellular proteases such as Lon (P0A9M0) and ClpXP (CPX-3176), leaving the toxins to exert their effectsl which result in growth arrest and cell dormancy. Both the antitoxin and, in most cases, the TA complex bind the TA promoter to repress transcription, with TA complexes repressing transcription more efficiently than the antitoxins alone by increasing the co-operativity of antitoxin binding to operators.The toxin yafQ degrades mRNA at adenosine-rich codons, most likely while it is bound to the ribosome.

CPX-108	Nuclear export complex Frat1-Gsk3b	Role in beta-catenin destruction complex disassembly. Gsk3b-Frat1 cannot bind to Axin and thus Gsk3b is inhibited from participating in the Axin-dependent phosphorylation of Ctnnb1. Initially forms a quaternary Frat1-Dvl-Gsk3b-AXIN complex which dissociates, with Gsk3b maintaining its association with Frat1. Gsk3b-Frat1 then translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The binding of Frat1 does not inhibit Gsk3b from phosphorylating glycogen synthase.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:10090

Active mainly during embryogenesis and tumorigenesis.	coding-region determinant of instability-mediated mRNA stability complex|coding-region instability determinant -mediated mRNA stability complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606
CPX-1081	RelBE toxin-antitoxin complex	Type II toxin-antitoxin (TA) system formed by the toxin (relE), and the antitoxin (relB). TA systems act as effectors of dormancy and persistence, with the toxin causing growth arrest by interfering with a vital cellular process, such as transcription, translation or DNA replication, and the cognate antitoxin neutralizing the toxin activity during normal growth conditions. Free relE toxin is capable of cleaving mRNA during translation at the ribosomal A site, thus inhibiting translation during amino acid starvation (the stringent response). The antitoxin, relB, both binds and inhibits relE by inducing conformational changes in the relE active site. Under conditions of stress the antitoxins are selectively degraded by cellular proteases such as Lon (P0A9M0) and ClpXP (CPX-3176), leaving the toxins to exert their effectsl which result in growth arrest and cell dormancy. Both the antitoxin and, in most cases, the TA complex bind the TA promoter to repress transcription, with TA complexes repressing transcription more efficiently than the antitoxins alone by increasing the co-operativity of antitoxin binding to operators.

CPX-1082	Flagellar Motor Switch Complex, CW variant	Plays a role in chemotaxis, the movement toward or away from chemicals. The flagellar motor of bacteria is a rotary device energized by the membrane ion gradient and the complex is required for the rotation and directional switching of the flagellum and also functions in flagellar assembly. Motor torque is produced at the top of the switch complex, where the fliG C-terminal domain bears several conserved charged residues that interact with charged groups of the stator protein motA (P09348). The conformation of this complex is such that the flagellum rotates in a clockwise (CW) direction, induced by binding of cheY-P to the lower part of the C-ring.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:83333
CPX-1083	Cobalamin outer membrane transporter complex	A member of the TonB-dependent transporter family (TBDTs) which binds and then transports cobalamine (vitamin B12) across the outer membrane. TBDTs are energy-dependent gated channels that usually transport large metal complexes which cannot fit through porins, and are too scarce to enter by mass-action-driven transport. Energy-dependent uptake through TBDTs requires interaction with tonB in complex with exbB and exbD in the inner membrane, ExbBD. tonB undergoes rapid energized movement driven by ExbBD which harvest the electrochemical force from the electrochemical proton gradient created by the proton gradient across the inner membrane and convert it into rotational motion. Hence, tonB may pull or twist the N-termini of TBDTs to promote transport of substrates into the periplasm. ATP-binding-cassette (ABC) transporters subsequently move the cyanocobalamine through the periplasm and inner membrane.

CPX-1084	MqsRA toxin-antitoxin complex	Type II toxin-antitoxin (TA) module consisting of MqsR toxins bound to MqsA antitoxin dimer. TA systems act as effectors of dormancy and persistence and are composed of a toxin, which causes growth arrest by interfering with a vital cellular process, and a cognate antitoxin, which neutralizes the toxin activity during normal growth conditions. Under conditions of stress the antitoxins are selectively degraded, leaving the toxins to exert their toxic effects, leading to growth arrest and dormancy. Type II TA complexes are small protein-protein pairs; under growth conditions, the toxin is bound to the antitoxin, which inhibits its activity. Unlike other type II toxins, mqsR does not enhance the binding of mqsA to the mqsRA promoter. Instead, MqsR disrupts the MqsA-DNA interaction. Under stress conditions, cellular proteases such as Lon (P0A9M0) and ClpXP (CPX-3176) are activated that preferentially cleave the antitoxins, freeing the toxins to inhibit growth by inhibiting translation or replication, enabling cells to enter a metabolically dormant state until the stress is removed. MqsR toxin is the most up-regulated gene in the persister phenotype of cells. When active, MqsA binds its promoter with extremely tight affinity, however this is destabilized by TA complex formation as the binding sites of MqsR and DNA on MqsA overlap and their binding is mutually exclusive. Plays a role in biofilm formation.	MqsR - MqsA complex|MqsR:MqsA2:MqsR		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:83333

The flagellar motor of bacteria is a rotary device energized by the membrane ion gradient and the complex is required for the rotation and directional switching of the flagellum and also functions in flagellar assembly. Motor torque is produced at the top of the switch complex, where the fliG C-terminal domain bears several conserved charged residues that interact with charged groups of the stator protein motA (P09348). The conformation of this complex is such that the flagellum rotates in a counter-clockwise (CCW) direction.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:83333
CPX-1086	MazEF toxin-antitoxin complex	Type II toxin-antitoxin (TA) system formed by the toxin (maxF), and the antitoxin (mazE). TA systems act as effectors of dormancy and persistence, with the toxin causing growth arrest by interfering with a vital cellular process, such as transcription, translation or DNA replication, and the cognate antitoxin neutralizing the toxin activity during normal growth conditions. Presence of free mazF toxin induces programmed cell death by cleavage of RNA specifically at ACA sequences to block protein synthesis. Under conditions of stress the antitoxins are selectively degraded by cellular proteases such as Lon (P0A9M0) and ClpXP (CPX-3176), leaving the toxins to exert their effectsl which result in growth arrest and cell dormancy. Both the antitoxin and, in most cases, the TA complex bind the TA promoter to repress transcription, with TA complexes repressing transcription more efficiently than the antitoxins alone by increasing the co-operativity of antitoxin binding to operators.

CPX-1088	Chemotaxis phosphorelay complex CheY-CheZ	Plays a role in chemotaxis, the movement toward or away from chemicals. The flagellar motor of bacteria is a rotary device energized by the membrane ion gradient and the complex is required for the rotation and directional switching of the flagellum and also functions in flagellar assembly. Motor torque is produced at the top of the switch complex, where the fliG C-terminal domain bears several conserved charged residues that interact with charged groups of the stator protein motA (P09348). The directionality of the rotation is determined by binding of cheY-P to the lower part of the C-ring which switches the directionality from counter-clockwise to clockwise. The cheY-cheZ complex enhances the dephosphorylation rate of P-cheY. This dephosphorylation reduces the binding of cheY to the switch and ensures rapid locomotor responses to changes in the supply of signaling phosphoryl groups to cheY, thus enabling a continuous response to environmental changes.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:83333

CSNK1A1 phosphorylates CTNNB1 on Ser-45 and primes successive phosphorylation of Thr-41, Ser-37, and Ser-33 by GSK3. Phosphorylation of CTNNB1 promotes its subsequent ubiquitination which targets the protein for degradation by the proteasome. Without Wnt, Axin is also phosphorylated by GSK3, and thereby kept in an active, open conformation for beta-catenin binding and degradation.

Part of a seven-subunit assembly that spans the cellular envelope. Inserts LPS laterally into the outer leaflet of the outer membrane where it is dispersed across the extracellular surface.A lateral gate in the beta-barrel of LptD allows LPS to proceed to the outer leaflet of the outer membrane. The specific disulfide bond configuration of the lptDE heterodimer restricts the size of the lateral gate on the periplasmic side, and may prevent incorrect insertion of LPS into the inner leaflet of the outer membrane. lptE is embedded into the lptD lumen, thus potentially preserving membrane impermeability.

CPX-1094	YgjD-YeaZ-YjeE complex	Catalyses the transfer of the threonylcarbamoyl-moiety of threonylcarbamoyladenylate onto A37 of substrate tRNA in the cytoplasm, or more probably in E.coli, the formation of 'cyclic t6A' (ct6A), which is a cyclized active ester with an oxazolone ring. The N6-threonylcarbamoyladenosine (t6A) modification is present at position 37 of tRNAs that recognize ANN-codons, with N being any nucleotide, enhancing the codon-anti-codon interaction and is required for recognition of the AUG start codon. The modification is thus important for maintaining translational fidelity. A stable YgjD-YeaZ heterodimer first forms, which has an atypical ADP-binding site at the YgjD-YeaZ interface that may also be the binding site for YjeE as the ternary complex only forms in the presence of ATP. An additional YrdC protein is necessary for T6a activity.	KEOPS|N(6)-L-threonylcarbamoyladenine synthase complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:83333
CPX-1095	Holo-translocon SecYEG-SecDF-YajC-YidC complex	Functions in both protein secretion to the trans side of the plasma membrane and insertion of membrane proteins into the lipid bilayer. The HTL complex is more proficient in cotranslational membrane protein insertion compared with SecYEG (CPX-1096) alone and the post-translational secretion of a beta-barreled outer-membrane protein driven by secA and ATP becomes much more dependent on the proton-motive force than is the case for SecYEG. The yidC periplasmic and secD periplasmic region P1-head domains are positioned to interact with translocation substrates preventing backsliding of the polypeptide through the translocation channel.

The ribosome nascent chain complex is then passed onto the dimeric SecYEG complex and the nascent membrane protein is threaded through the protein channel and into the bilayer via a lateral gate.

The complex recognizes, and binds to, an 11-nucleotide mooring sequence downstream of the editing site and, in addition to C to U editing, also protects the edited ApoB mRNA from nonsense-mediated decay. APOBEC1 mediates nucleocytoplasmic shuttling via its respective nuclear localisation and export signals. The editosome binds its target mRNA in the nucleus and retains its edited form during nuclear export, transporting the ApoB48 RNA to the cytoplasm for translation. In neurofibromatosis type I patients the complex deaminates a CGA (Arg) to an UGA (Stop) in the NF1 mRNA. May play a role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression via APOBEC1's oxidative demetylation activity of 5-hydroxymethylcytosines (5hmCs).

CPX-1099	B-WICH chromatin remodelling complex	An ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex that exposes DNA by sliding away histone octamers. Positively regulates histone H3 acetylation, in particular H3K9, by recruiting several histone acetyltransferases (HATs), such as KAT2B (PCAF, Q92831), p300 (Q09472), and KAT2A (GCN5, Q92830). Binds to both ribosomal DNA promoters and coding regions. Facilitates RNA polymerase I and III transcription by preventing compaction of chromatin at rDNA loci allowing HATs to assemble. An open chromatin structure is a prerequisite for the binding of the RNA polymerase machinery and also the regulatory factor MYC (P01106), which activates both RNA pol I genes and RNA pol III genes. May also activate RNA polymerase II gene transcription. The different subunits of the complex potentially have specific roles that lead to the stepwise modification of chromatin, and may not all associate simultaneously with the BAZ1B-SMARCA5 core. The B-WICH assembly may thus represent a number of smaller complexes. At the start of the cell division process, when Pol I transcription is arrested, B-WICH is in a disassembled state due to the phosphorylation of BAZ1B. The complex assembles on the active gene during early G1 phase. Polymeric actin interacts with Pol I, an interaction that is required for transcription. One speculative model is that NM1 (O00159-3) interacts with actin and the rDNA via its C-terminus, generating local force that pulls the polymerase along the active gene. Once dissociated from actin, NM1 interacts with SMARCA5 in a BAZ1B-dependent manner, a mechanism that stabilizes the complex on the rDNA. Additional components then assemble into the B-WICH complex(es) mediated by specific RNA species. Particularly important during embryonic and neonatal development, especially for craniofacial features.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606

Gsk3b-Frat2 cannot bind to Axin and thus Gsk3b is inhibited from participating in the Axin-dependent phosphorylation of Ctnnb1. Initially forms a quaternary Frat2-Dvl-Gsk3b-AXIN complex which dissociates, with Gsk3b maintaining its association with Frat2. Gsk3b-Frat2 then translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The binding of Frat2 does not inhibit Gsk3b from phosphorylating glycogen synthase.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:10090
CPX-1100	DRM complex	Transcription factor complex with a role in in germline X-chromosome regulation. Appears to repress transcription of germline-expressed genes and promote expression of somatic and X-linked genes. The complex represses transcription in vulval precursor cells to negatively regulate vulval development. This is most probably via antagonism of the Ras-signalling pathway.

CPX-1101	RNA polymerase I upstream activating factor complex	Binds tightly to the upstream element of the yeast Pol I promoter and is essential for a high level of transcription of the 35S rRNA gene. UAF has dual functions: both as a positive transcription factor for Pol I, and as a silencer for Pol II transcription of rRNA genes. Deletion of any one of the subunit protein genes encoding essential nonhistone proteins causes derepression of Pol II transcription of the 35S rRNA genes. The association of H3 and H4 with the other UAF components is important for the stability of UAF in vivo and, hence, for rRNA transcription by Pol I. Initiation of transcription requires the assembly of UAF, the core factor (CPX-1836), the TATA binding protein SPT15 (P13393), and RNAP-I (CPX-1664) with RRN3 (P36070) on the upstream element and core promoter. Upon transcription initiation, UAF, RRN3 and CF dissociate from the promoter.	RNA polymerase I UAF|UAF|upstream activating factor complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:559292
CPX-1102	Ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase variant 1	Catalyzes the reduction of ribonucleotides to the corresponding deoxyribonucleotides, an essential step in the de novo synthesis of monomeric precursors for DNA replication and repair. The catalytically active form is an alpha2beta2 tetramer. The homodimeric alpha subunit, called R1, houses the active site, composed of redox-active disulfides, and binding sites for allosteric effectors, ribonucleoside diphosphates. The beta subunit, called R2, contains a di-iron cluster that in its reduced state reacts with dioxygen to form a stable tyrosyl radical (Y*) and a di-iron(III) cluster. This essential Y* is proposed to generate a thiyl radical, located on a cysteine residue in the R1 active site, that initiates ribonucleotide reduction. The enzyme is allosterically controlled by relative levels of dNTPs. This variant is found in all cell states, a related variant (CPX-1103) is only found in damaged or growth-arrested cells. the small subunit, RNR2-RNR4, is nuclear while the large subunit, RNR1, is cytoplasmic. In response to S-phase or DNA-damage, RNR2-RNR4 enters the cytoplasm to bind RNR1.	2'-deoxyribonucleoside-diphosphate:oxidized-thioredoxin 2'-oxidoreductase|RNR|Ribonucleoside 5'-diphosphate reductase|Ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase|Ribonucleotide diphosphate reductase|Ribonucleotide reductase|Ribonucleotide-diphosphate reductase		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:559292

CPX-1111	Importin complex, Snurportin variant	A nuclear import complex that functions as a nuclear import receptor and specifically imports m3G-capped U snRNAs. Docking of the importin/substrate complex to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) is mediated by Kpnb1. Kpnb1 binds to nucleoporin FxFG repeats and the complex is subsequently translocated through the pore by an energy requiring, Ran-dependent mechanism. At the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC, Ran-GTP (P62827) binds to Kpnb1, the three components separate and Snupn and Kpnb1 are re-exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where GTP is hydrolysed. The directionality of nuclear import is thought to be conferred by an asymmetric distribution of the GTP- and GDP-bound forms of Ran between the cytoplasm and nucleus.

CPX-1123	FOXO3-MYC complex	A transcription factor repressor complex involved in regulating cell proliferation by repressing transcription of genes involved in negative regulation of mitotic cell cycle. The interaction of MYC with FOXO3 is likely to occur at the target gene promoter and inhibits FOXO3s activating effect on target gene transcription. The half life of the FOXO3-MYC complex is not known, but most likely to be of limited time span, in line with rapid dynamics of changes in transcription regulation in response to internal and external cues. Another variant of FOXO3-MYC interaction has been observed where FOXO3 seems to facilitate displacement of MYC from its promoters, thereby antagonizing MYC function in metabolic adaption to hypoxia.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606
CPX-1124	Telomerase holoenzyme complex	A reverse transcriptase complex that is essential for maintenance of telomeres. Catalytic subunit Tert and RNA template terc (CPX-19) are essential for telomerase activity. Elongates the single-stranded G-rich 3-prime protruding ends of chromosomal DNA using Terc RNA as a template. Terc, Dkc1, Gar1, Nhp2 & Nop10 form the box H/ACA telomerase ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex which then binds to Tert forming the telomerase holoenzyme complex. Wrap53 (also known as Tcab1, Q8VC51) binds to the CAB box in Terc and facilitates localization of the telomerase complex to Cajal bodies. In S-phase, telomerase holoenzyme complex is targeted from Cajal bodies to telomeres by binding of Tert to the shelterin subunit, Acd (Q5EE38).			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:10090

CPX-1126	Cyclin cyd-1-cdk4 complex	Cyclin-dependent protein kinase activity. Required for G1 to S phase transition of the mitotic cell cycle. Cdk-4 phosphorylates the Rb protein lin-35 at Ser-714 and Thr-719 which inhibits the transcriptional repressor activity of lin-35 and allows for progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle during postembryonic development. The complex also regulates the asymmetric division of the somatic gonadal precursor cell to determine sex during gonadogenesis and controls the expression of growth and metabolic genes in muscle cells, in addition to cell cycle genes.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:6239
CPX-1127	Cyclin cye-1-cdk2 complex	Cyclin-dependent protein kinase complex. Required for G1 to S phase transition of the mitotic cell cycle. Hyper-phosphorylation of Rb proteins by the complex leads to their inactivation which allows transcription of E2F-controlled genes. Regulates proliferation, quiescent state and cell fate during the development of several cell lineages. Phosphorylates and inhibits the translational repressor gld-1 and thus prevents entry into meiosis in order to regulate the pool of germline stem cells and the size of the mitotic zone in the gonads.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:6239

Component of the daf-2 insulin receptor-like signalling cascade that controls daf-16-mediated gene expression. The forkhead transcription factor daf-16 regulates the expression of genes involved in metabolism, development, dauer formation, longevity and the response to stress. The complex functions downstream of pkd-1 in the signalling cascade to antagonize daf-16 by phosphorylation. The complex is activated by pdk-1 phosphorylation. The activated complex then controls the intracellular localisation and activation of daf-16.	Akt/Pkb kinase complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:6239
CPX-113	Survivin homodimer complex	An anti-apoptotic pre-assembly complex that provides one protomer to the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC).

CPX-1130	Beta-catenin-lit-1 complex	Serine/threonine protein kinase complex. Acts as an effector in the wnt signalling pathway to control the asymmetry of cell divisions in embryogenesis by down-regulating pop-1 activity. pop-1 is a protein related to the vertebrate TCF/LEF transcription factors, and is required for cell fate decisions and in particular, for anterior/posterior cell divisions. The complex regulates pop-1 localization and is required for the pop-1/par-5 interaction. Specifically lit-1 Interacts with wrm-1 (via N-terminus); activates lit-1 kinase activity and the lit-1/wrm-1 dimer phosphorylates pop-1 at Ser-118 and Ser-127. This promotes pop-1 interaction with par-5 and translocation of pop-1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.	wrm-1/lit-1 kinase complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:6239
CPX-1131	Prmt-5-cep-1-cbp-1 complex	Represses transcriptional activation in response to DNA damage. prmt-5 interacts with, but does not methylate, cep-1 and with cbp-1 which results in the methylation of cbp-1. Cep-1 transcriptional activity may be inhibited by its interaction with methylated cbp-1. The formation of this complex may prevent apoptosis by repressing the capacity of cbp-1 to enhance cep-1 dependent transcriptional activation of the programmed cell death activator egl-1.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:6239
CPX-1132	gls-1-gld-3 complex	Translation regulator complex which, in early embryos, promotes the expression of mRNAs that encode germline survival factors. During hermaphrodite development, the complex promotes the sperm/oocyte switch by freeing the translational repressor fbf-1 to turn off sperm promoting factors. The complex is essential for germline survival during post-embryonic germline development. Upon dissociation of the complex, germ cells fail to survive into adulthood.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:6239
CPX-1133	B-WICH chromatin remodelling complex	An ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex that exposes DNA by sliding away histone octamers. Positively regulates histone H3 acetylation, in particular H3K9, by recruiting several histone acetyltransferases (HATs), such as Kat2b (Pcaf, Q9JHD1), p300 (B2RWS6), and Kat2a (Gcn5, Q9JHD2). Binds to both ribosomal DNA promoters and coding regions. Facilitates RNA polymerase I and III transcription by preventing compaction of chromatin at rDNA loci allowing HATs to assemble. An open chromatin structure is a prerequisite for the binding of the RNA polymerase machinery and also the regulatory factor Myc (P01108), which activates both RNA pol I genes and RNA pol III genes. May also activate RNA polymerase II gene transcription. The different subunits of the complex potentially have specific roles that lead to the stepwise modification of chromatin, and may not all associate simultaneously with the Baz1b-Smarca5 core. The B-WICH assembly may thus represent a number of smaller complexes. At the start of the cell division process, when Pol I transcription is arrested, B-WICH is in a disassembled state due to the phosphorylation of Baz1b. The complex assembles on the active gene during early G1 phase. Polymeric actin interacts with Pol I, an interaction that is required for transcription. One speculative model is that Nm1 (Q9WTI7-3) interacts with actin and the rDNA via its C-terminus, generating local force that pulls the polymerase along the active gene. Once dissociated from actin, Nm1 interacts with Smarca5 in a Baz1b-dependent manner, a mechanism that stabilizes the complex on the rDNA. Additional components then assemble into the B-WICH complex(es) mediated by specific RNA species. Particularly important during embryonic and neonatal development, especially for craniofacial features.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:10090

In the case of PIC formation at transfer DNA (tDNA) genes, TFIIIC recognizes the gene-internal box A and B elements, while TFIIIB localizes further upstream. TFIIIA (P39933) is required only for the transcription of 5S rRNA, where it recognizes the gene-internal control element, box C, to further recruit TFIIIC and TFIIIB. Once assembled upstream of the start site, TFIIIB generates a significant DNA distortion of the class III gene promoter through the SPT15 and BDP1 subunits.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:559292

TFIIF and TFIIE bind open promoter DNA from opposite sides of the Pol II cleft. TFIIF adopts an extended induced structure that allows it to retain the upstream DNA–SPT15–TFIIB assembly on the wall and to bind the DNA bubble.

CPX-1154	CPAP-STIL complex	A protein complex that is required for centriole biogenesis and duplication. During procentriole formation during G1/S transition, PKL4 (Q7ZVS3) activates STIL by phosphorylating its STAN domain, then activated STIL loads SASS6 and CENPJ (CPAP) to the base of the procentriole to initiate procentriole assembly. Together with CEP135 (Q5RG45), CENPJ and SASS6 form the central scaffolding of the 9-fold symmetry of the procentriole. In the assembled centriole 9 homodimers of SASS6 form the central waggon wheel while CEP135 and CENPJ connect SASS6 to the microtubules. Lack of the complex or any of its subunits leads to a loss of centriole formation or spindle formation while overexpression leads to overly long centrioles.

CPX-11548	DBF4-dependent CDC7 kinase complex	Serine/threonine-protein kinase essential for the initiation of DNA replication. Associates with replication origins where it phosphorylates components of the prereplicative complex including the MCM helicase (CPX-2940). Phosphorylates the RAD9 component of the checkpoint clamp complex component (CPX-1829) in response to replication-induced DNA damage.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606
CPX-1155	CoQ biosynthetic complex	Required for the synthesis of Coenzyme Q (CoQ), an isoprenylated benzoquinone which functions as an electron carrier from complex I or II to complex III in the inner mitochondrial membrane and which also acts as an antioxidant preventing the oxidation of lipoproteins and the plasma membrane. Assembly of the complex appears to be triggered by 4-hydroxyl-3-hexaprenyl benzoate (HHB) which is a precursor of CoQ.	Coenzyme Q synthesis complex|Q-synthome		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:559292
CPX-1156	Central kinetochore CTF19 complex	Present in the central kinetochore, where is appears to play a role in the enhancement of cohesin in the pericentromere. May help to mediate the attachment of the centromere to the mitotic spindle by forming interactions between the microtubule-associated outer kinetochore proteins and the centromere-associated inner kinetochore proteins. The COMA subcomplex proteins (CPX-1187) bind to the inner kinetochore proteins whilst the more peripheral proteins do not. Several of the subunits (IML3, CHL4, CTF19, MCM21, CTF3, MCM16 and MCM22) appear to be non-essential although their absence has a significant role in chromosome segregation in meiosis and more limited effects during mitosis. MTW1 is only present in low levels so may only associate with the complex.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:559292
CPX-1157	CUL8-MMS1-MMS22-ESC4 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex	Ubiquitin ligase complex required for the ubiquition of acetylated histone H3, thus facilitating nucleosome assembly during replication and promoting replication progression during S-phase. RTT107 may recruit and help load the complex onto a DNA damage site at or near a stalled replication fork.	CRL complex|Cullin-RING ligase complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:559292
CPX-1158	GABA-B receptor complex	G-protein-coupled, metabotropic transmembrane receptor for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Within the heterodimeric GABA receptor, only gbb-1 seems to bind agonists, while gbb-2 mediates coupling to G proteins. Ligand binding causes a conformation change that triggers signaling via guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) and modulates the activity of down-stream effectors, such as adenylate cyclase. Signaling inhibits adenylate cyclase, stimulates phospholipase A2, activates potassium channels, inactivates voltage-dependent calcium-channels and modulates inositol phospholipid hydrolysis. Plays a critical role in the fine-tuning of inhibitory synaptic transmission. Pre-synaptic GABA receptor inhibits neurotransmitter release by down-regulating high-voltage activated calcium channels, whereas postsynaptic GABA receptor decreases neuronal excitability by activating a prominent inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) conductance that underlies the late inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. May couple to the G(o) alpha G-protein goa-1 (P51875) to negatively regulate cholinergic receptor activity in the presence of high levels of acetylcholine in ventral cord motor neurons. As acetylcholine depolarizes body wall muscles, modulation of acetylcholine levels most likely results in the control of locomotory behavior.

CPX-1159	CPAP-STIL complex	A protein complex that is required for centriole biogenesis and duplication. During procentriole formation during G1/S transition, PKL4 (O00444) activates STIL by phosphorylating its STAN domain, then activated STIL loads SASS6 and CENPJ (CPAP) to the base of the procentriole to initiate procentriole assembly. Together with CEP135 (Q66GS9), CENPJ and SASS6 form the central scaffolding of the 9-fold symmetry of the procentriole. In the assembled centriole 9 homodimers of SASS6 form the central waggon wheel while CEP135 and CENPJ connect SASS6 to the microtubules. Lack of the complex or any of its subunits leads to a loss of centriole formation or spindle formation while overexpression leads to overly long centrioles. Patients with autosomal recessive primary microcephaly often present with aberrant spindle positioning in progenitor cells during brain development and mutations in CENPJ or STIL.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606
CPX-116	Chromosomal passenger complex	Serine/threonine kinase complex which ensures chromosome bi-orientation on the mitotic spindle during metaphase by phosphorylating multiple kinetochore components. It destabilizes monopolar attachments by phosphorylating key proteins at the kinetophore. The chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) regulates chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. Disruption of any of its four members from the complex results in structural impairment and subsequent mislocalization of the CPC.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606
CPX-1160	CEP152-PLK4 complex	A protein complex essential for centriole biogenesis; temporarily part of the procentriole to which it recruits further proteins involved in procentriole formation. Snatches PLK4 away from CEP192-PLK4 complex (CPX-1298). Impairment of centriole duplication eventually leads to impaired spindle formation and mitosis which is linked to tumorigenesis.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:10090
CPX-1161	CEP192-PLK4 complex	A protein complex essential for centriole biogenesis; temporarily part of the procentriole to which it recruits further proteins involved in procentriole formation. PLK4 is snatched away from CEP192 (O94986) by CEP152 forming CEP152-PLK4 complex (CPX-1160). Impairment of centriole duplication eventually leads to impaired spindle formation and mitosis which is linked to tumorigenesis.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606
CPX-1162	Fatty-acyl-CoA synthase	Catalyzes the formation of long-chain fatty acids from acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA and NADPH. Consists of a multifunctional enzyme composed of two non-identical alpha and beta subunits which are organized in an alpha6beta6 complex with 6 sites of fatty acid synthesis. The alpha subunit, FAS2, contains domains for acyl carrier protein, 3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] reductase, and 3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] synthase. The beta subunit, FAS 1, contains domains for [acyl-carrier-protein] acetyltransferase and malonyltransferase, S-acyl fatty acid synthase thioesterase, enoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] reductase, and 3-hydroxypalmitoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] dehydratase.

The complex is required for the trafficking of specific proteins as actin filaments also mediate myosin-driven short-range movement of proteins within endosomal compartments. The WASH complex is recruited to endosomes by the retromer complex. WASH genes duplicated to multiple chromosomal ends during evolution, and the WASH repertoire of humans, and therefore the number of complex variants, may vary among individuals.

CPX-1164	SWI/SNF ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex, ACTL6A-ARID1A-SMARCA2 variant	An ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex which is recruited to tissue- and lineage-specific promoters and enhancers of target genes and then alters chromatin structure. The precise process is undefined but the complex appears to reduce the superhelicity of the promoter region DNA around nucleosomes and may produce short DNA loops that are detached from the the nucleosomes, enabling access to the promoter region for a range of transcription factors and the pre-initiation complex (PIC). The complex also plays a role in double-strand break and nucleotide excision repair mechanisms and in the decatenation of newly replicated sister chromatids, a requirement for proper chromosome segregation during mitosis. Also targeted to chromatin by phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate which promotes the complex binding to actin filaments. The complex additionally interacts with a range of nuclear receptors and the vitamin D receptor (VDR, P11473) via SMARCD subunits. Regulates cell differentiation in several lineages, such as T cells and myocytes, and specific variants exist in embryonic stem cells (esBAF) and neuronal progenitor cells (npBAF). Acts as transcriptional repressor of neuronal genes in non-neuronal cells by interacting with the REST repressor complex and histone deacetylases (HDACs). In this variant of the complex transcriptional repression is probably driven by the presence of the ARID1A subunit. The SWI/SNF complexes have been reported as consisting of 8 to 14 subunits. It is likely that the two ATPases, SMARCA2/BRM (this complex) and SMARCA4/BRG1 (CPX-1204) do not co-occur in the same complex. SMARCD1 (BAF60A) and SMARCD2 (BAF60B) also may not co-occur. The following proteins may be associated with SWI/SNF (BAF) complex variants, with one or more from each family present in any given complex: DPF2/BAF45D (Q92785), BRD9 (Q9H8M2), SS18 (Q15532), BCL11A (Q9H165), BCL11B (Q9C0K0), BCL7A (Q4VC05), BCL7B (Q9BQE9), BCL7C (Q8WUZ0). Mutations in several subunits affect tissue and developmental processes such as nervous system and cardiac development and maintenance of pluripotency resulting in tumorigenesis or the development of intellectual disorders.

CPX-1178	Cytoplasmic dynein complex	A microtubule minus end-directed motor complex involved in positioning the mitotic spindle during cell division. Yeast undergoes a closed mitosis, and therefore the nucleus and its mitotic spindle must be positioned across the junction between the mother and bud, termed the bud neck, to provide a set of chromosomes to the daughter cell. Dynein anchors to the bud end and becomes activated, allowing force generation between the microtubule and the cortex. The microtubule is pulled to slide along the cortex, causing the spindle to move into the mother-bud neck .Chemical transitions (ATP binding, ATP hydrolysis and the release of inorganic phosphate (Pi) and ADP) are coupled to structural changes in the motor, whilst conversely, mechanical events (such as microtubule binding) can influence the rate of chemical transitions.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:559292

Mediates dendritic spine loss leading to decreased synapse density, inhibition of long-term potentiation (LTP), enhancement of long-term depression (LTD), excessive calcium influx, mitochondrial impairment, endoplasmic reticulum stress and activation of apoptotic processes. May bind plasma membrane lipids affecting their stability and leading to cytotoxicity. May affect metal ion homeostasis by chelating synaptic copper, zinc or iron ions. Oligomers of protein 42 only may have positive neurogenetic effects by activating synaptic protein kinases. Mostly found in the extracellular space with a small proportion occurring as membrane-bound species. Dimers (CPX-1108) and oligomers of soluble amyloid-beta peptides are the main pathogenic species linked to Alzheimer's disease. Cellular prion protein (PrPC/Prnp, P13852) binds amyloid-beta oligomers mediating their synaptic dysfunction. Insoluble fibrils and plaques form during the latter stages of the disease. Chaperones, such as alphaB-crystallins or clusterin (P05371), bind to misfolded oligomeric species and form long-lived complexes, thereby preventing both their further growth into fibrils and their dissociation into synaptotoxic dimers. Amyloid-beta peptide may act as transcription factor for its own precursor protein APP and its cleavage enzyme BACE1 (P56819) initiating a positive feedback mechanism that ultimately leads to amyloidogenesis and Alzheimer's disease.

CPX-1185	DCS1-DCS2 regulator of decapping scavenger complex	m7G(5')pppN diphosphatase with a kcat/KM value that is significantly lower than that of the Decapping Scavenger complex, DCS1 (CPX-1179) and has almost lost the preference for m7GpppG as a substrate shown by the homodimer. Degrades the 5' mRNA cap, releasing m7GMP, when the cap is no longer attached to the mRNA body but rather within short capped mRNA fragments that are generated from 3' to 5' mRNA decay. DCS2 is only expressed by the cell under conditions of diauxic stress, and the formation of this complex may allow the cell to change the distribution and relative activities of the mRNA decay pathways in the stationary phase cell.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:559292
CPX-1186	Kinetochore MIS12 complex	Required for normal chromosome alignment and segregation, kinetochore formation during mitosis, proper kinetochore microtubule attachments and for the spindle assembly checkpoint. The complex plays a role in establishing a bipolar spindle-kinetochore interaction by joining kinetochore subunits contacting DNA to those contacting microtubules. Mis12/MIND is part of a tridentate linker layer, which also contains the Ndc80 (CPX-548) and COMA (CPX-1187) complexes. Evidence suggests interactions between COMA, MIND, and Ndc80 complexes. The Mis12/MIND complex is a platform onto which outer kinetochore proteins assemble, including microtubule-binding proteins. It is proposed to have a distinct function with respect to force generation and microtubule attachment. In the absence of MIND, there is bipolar binding without the generation of sufficient pulling force to cause centromere stretching and transient sister-chromatid separation. MIND requires CBF3 complex for assembly onto centromeric DNA. Different combinations of MIND subunits have been found, which may reflect the regulated steps in kinetochore assembly.

CPX-1187	COMA complex	Heterotetrameric subcomplex of a larger central kinetochore CTF19 complex (CPX-1156). COMA is part of a tridentate linker layer, which also contains the Ndc80 (CPX-548) and MIND (CPX-1186) complexes. Although the COMA, MIND, and Ndc80 complexes assemble independently, evidence suggests subsequent interactions. COMA is a platform onto which outer kinetochore proteins assemble, including microtubule-binding proteins. It is proposed to have a distinct function with respect to force generation and microtubule attachment. In the absence of COMA, there is bipolar binding without the generation of sufficient pulling force to cause centromere stretching and transient sister-chromatid separation. COMA requires CBF3 complex (CPX-1898) for assembly onto centromeric DNA. Different combinations of COMA subunits have been found, which may reflect the regulated steps in kinetochore assembly.

CPX-1188	DPB11-SLD3-SLD2 DNA replication complex	Associate with replication origins and promotes loading of DNA polymerases onto the origins to initiate chromosomal DNA replication when cyclin-dependent kinase activity increases at the G1/S cell cycle boundary. May play an active role in assembly or activation of the replication fork CMG helicase (CPX-297) thus playing a role in a critical S phase regulatory mechanism that restricts DNA replication to S phase. Interaction of the complex with with single-stranded DNA may be important for GINS attachment to MCM.	11–3–2 complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:559292
CPX-1189	RAD26-DEF1 stalled RNAPII response complex	Appears to form in response to DNA damage-stalled RNA polymerase II (RNAPII, CPX-2662), when the stall is persistent such as at DNA lesions. RAD26 appears to protect RNAPII from degradation to allow time for repair. When the lesion cannot be rapidly removed by RAD26-promoted DNA repair, DEF1 enables ubiquitination and proteolysis of RNAPII. The complex may therefore act to coordinate a stalling rescue mechanism driven by the two proteins.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:559292
CPX-119	Chromosomal passenger complex	Serine/threonine kinase complex which ensures chromosome bi-orientation on the mitotic spindle during metaphase by phosphorylating multiple kinetochore components. It destabilizes monopolar attachments by phosphorylating key proteins at the kinetophore. The chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) regulates chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. Disruption of any of its four members from the complex results in structural impairment and subsequent mislocalization of the CPC.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:10090
CPX-1190	TUL1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex	E3 ubiquitin ligase complex required in cells lacking the multivesicular body pathway and under conditions of ubiquitin depletion.

CPX-1191	Global genome repair CUL3-RAD7-RAD16-ELC1 ubiquitin ligase complex	A ubiquitin ligase complex required for optimal nucleotide excision repair following UV-induced DNA damage. Ubiquinates the DNA repair protein RAD4 (P14736), targeting it for degradation by the 26S proteasome following UV radiation. de novo protein synthesis subsequently restores RAD4 to pre-irradiation levels.

CPX-1192	Vacuolar proton translocating ATPase complex, Golgi variant	Translocates protons across a lipid bilayer via an ATP-driven rotary mechanism, thus acidifing the lumen of its resident organelle. As newly synthesized proteins traverse the Golgi apparatus they undergo post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, sulfation, and phosphorylation, and are targeted to their appropriate destination in a pH-dependent manner. Membrane-bound ion transporters/proton exchangers use the pH gradient to sequester metal ions to the vacuole and other cellular organelles. The combined action of the V-ATPase and membrane transporters plays a key role in maintaining cellular homoeostasis. The variant of the complex containing the STV1 subunit results in the retention of the V-ATPase complex on Golgi and endosomal membranes. The N-terminal domain of STV1 contains the W83KY sequence, which is necessary and sufficient for targeting the complex to the Golgi apparatus. When yeast cells are deprived of glucose, the V1 and VO regions separate and are no longer able to hydrolyze ATP and transport protons.

CPX-1193	Vacuolar proton translocating ATPase complex, vacuole variant	Translocates protons across a lipid bilayer via an ATP-driven rotary mechanism, thus acidifing the lumen of its resident organelle.

The combined action of the V-ATPase and membrane transporters plays a key role in maintaining cellular homoeostasis. The variant of the complex containing the VPH1 subunit results in the retention of the V-ATPase complex on vacuole membranes. When yeast cells are deprived of glucose, the V1 and VO regions separate and are no longer able to hydrolyze ATP and transport protons. Reassembly is mediated by the RAVE complex (CPX-1627).

CPX-1194	Muscle cell-specific SWI/SNF ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex, ACTL6A-ARID1A-SMARCA2 variant	An ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex which is recruited to promoters and enhancers of target genes in muscle cells and alters chromatin structure. The precise process is undefined but the complex appears to reduce the superhelicity of the promoter region DNA around nucleosomes and may produce short DNA loops that are detached from the the nucleosomes, enabling access to the promoter region for a range of transcription factors and the pre-initiation complex (PIC). The complex also plays a role in double-strand break and nucleotide excision repair mechanisms and in the decatenation of newly replicated sister chromatids, a requirement for proper chromosome segregation during mitosis. Also targeted to chromatin by phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate which promotes the complex binding to actin filaments. The complex additionally interacts with a range of nuclear receptors and the vitamin D receptor (VDR, P11473) via SMARCD subunits. SWI/SNF complexes containing DPF3 are specific to muscle cells where they play an essential role in the development of heart and skeletal muscle cells. Also found in brown adipocytes where they regulate gene-expression of brown fat-selective genes. Acts as transcriptional repressor of neuronal genes in non-neuronal cells by interacting with the REST repressor complex and histone deacetylases (HDACs). In this variant of the complex transcriptional repression is probably driven by the presence of the ARID1A subunit. The SWI/SNF complexes have been reported as consisting of 8 to 14 subunits. It is likely that the two ATPases, SMARCA2/BRM (this complex) and SMARCA4/BRG1 (CPX-1222) do not co-occur in the same complex. SMARCD1 (BAF60A) and SMARCD2 (BAF60B) also may not co-occur. The following proteins may be associated with SWI/SNF (BAF) complex variants, with one or more from each family present in any given complex: DPF2/BAF45D (Q92785), BRD9 (Q9H8M2), SS18 (Q15532), BCL11A (Q9H165), BCL11B (Q9C0K0), BCL7A (Q4VC05), BCL7B (Q9BQE9), BCL7C (Q8WUZ0). Mutations in several subunits affect tissue and developmental processes such as nervous system and cardiac development and maintenance of pluripotency resulting in tumorigenesis or the development of intellectual disorders.	muscle cell-specific BAF ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling complex|muscle cell-specific BAF complex|muscle cell-specific BRG1-associated factors complex|muscle cell-specific BRM-associated factors complex|muscle cell-specific Brahma complex|muscle cell-specific SWI/SNF ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex|muscle cell-specific SWI/SNF ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling complex|muscle cell-specific SWI/SNF complex|muscle cell-specific SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable complex|muscle cell-specific mSWI/SNF complex|muscle cell-specific mammalian SWI/SNF complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606
CPX-1195	Embryonic stem cell-specific SWI/SNF ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex	An ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex which is recruited to tissue- and lineage-specific promoters and enhancers of target genes and then alters chromatin structure. The precise process is undefined but the complex appears to reduce the superhelicity of the promoter region DNA around nucleosomes and may produce short DNA loops that are detached from the the nucleosomes, enabling access to the promoter region for a range of transcription factors and the pre-initiation complex (PIC). The complex also plays a role in double-strand break and nucleotide excision repair mechanisms and in the decatenation of newly replicated sister chromatids, a requirement for proper chromosome segregation during mitosis. Also targeted to chromatin by phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate which promotes the complex binding to actin filaments. The complex additionally interacts with a range of nuclear receptors and the vitamin D receptor (VDR, P11473) via SMARCD subunits. The embryonic stem cell-specific SWI/SNF complex is critical for self-renewal, maintenance and pluripotency of embryonic stem cells. The lack of subunit ARID1B suggests it primarily acts as a transcriptional repressor but also has the ability to activate some genes. The SWI/SNF complexes have been reported as consisting of 8 to 14 subunits. The embryonic stem cell-specific (esc-)SWI/SNF complex specifically lacks subunits ACTL6B (O94805), ARID1B (Q8NFD5), SMARCA2 (P51531), SMARCC2 (Q8TAQ2) and SMARCD3 (Q6STE5). SMARCD2 (Q92925) may be present in esc-SWI/SNF complexes in which case it probably forms a variant, replacing SMARCD1. BCL7A, BCL7B and BCL7C have been shown to be part of the esc-SWI/SNF complex but may be mutually exclusive and therefore probably forms further variants. Mutations in several subunits affect tissue and developmental processes such as nervous system and cardiac development and maintenance of pluripotency resulting in tumorigenesis or the development of intellectual disorders.	embryonic stem cell-specific BAF ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling complex|embryonic stem cell-specific BAF complex|embryonic stem cell-specific BRG1-associated factors complex|embryonic stem cell-specific BRM-associated factors complex|embryonic stem cell-specific Brahma complex|embryonic stem cell-specific SWI/SNF ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex|embryonic stem cell-specific SWI/SNF ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling complex|embryonic stem cell-specific SWI/SNF complex|embryonic stem cell-specific SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable complex|embryonic stem cell-specific mSWI/SNF complex|es-SWI/SNF complex|esBAF complex|esc-SWI/SNF complex|escBAF complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606

The complex also plays a role in double-strand break and nucleotide excision repair mechanisms and in the decatenation of newly replicated sister chromatids, a requirement for proper chromosome segregation during mitosis. Also targeted to chromatin by phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate which promotes the complex binding to actin filaments. The complex additionally interacts with a range of nuclear receptors and the vitamin D receptor (VDR, P11473) via SMARCD subunits. pBAF complexes facilitate the ligand-dependant transcriptional activation of target genes by nuclear hormone receptors and regulates cell differentiation, esp. in cardiac development. Acts as transcriptional repressor of neuronal genes in non-neuronal cells by interacting with the REST repressor complex and histone deacetylases (HDACs). The SWI/SNF complexes have been reported as consisting of 8 to 14 subunits. pBAF exists in two variants, containing either ACTL6A (this complex) or ACTL6B (CPX-1196) subunit. Subunit BRD7 may be restricted to pBAF complexes in embryonic stem cells and not present in differentiated cells. The alternative ATPase, SMARCA2/BRM (P51531), does not occur in the pBAF complexes. SMARCD1 (BAF60A) and SMARCD2 (BAF60B) may not co-occur. It is not clear if BCL7A (Q4VC05), BCL7B (Q9BQE9), BCL7C (Q8WUZ0) or SMARCD3 (Q6STE5) are part of any pBAF variants.

Also targeted to chromatin by phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate which promotes the complex binding to actin filaments. The complex additionally interacts with a range of nuclear receptors and the vitamin D receptor (VDR, P11473) via SMARCD subunits. The neural progenitor-specific SWI/SNF complex is critical for self-renewal, maintenance and pluripotency of neural progenitor stem cells by selectively activating or repressing its target genes. In this variant of the complex transcriptional repression is probably driven by the presence of the ARID1A subunit. During neural development a switch from a progenitor to a post-mitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. This process requires a switch of two subunits: ACTL6A is replaced by ACTL6B (O94805) and PHF10 replaced by DPF1 (Q92782) or DPF3 (Q92784) in neuron-specific SWI/SNF complexes. The SWI/SNF complexes have been reported as consisting of 8 to 14 subunits. Although similar in function to the embryonic stem cell-specific SWI/SNF complex the composition of the neural progenitor-specific SWI/SNF complexes is more similar to the standard SWI/SNF complexes. It is likely that the two ATPases, SMARCA2/BRM (this complex) and SMARCA4/BRG1 (CPX-1212) do not co-occur in the same complex. SMARCD1 (BAF60A) and SMARCD3 (BAF60C) also may not co-occur.

CPX-1204	SWI/SNF ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex, ACTL6A-ARID1A-SMARCA4 variant	An ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex which is recruited to tissue- and lineage-specific promoters and enhancers of target genes and then alters chromatin structure. The precise process is undefined but the complex appears to reduce the superhelicity of the promoter region DNA around nucleosomes and may produce short DNA loops that are detached from the the nucleosomes, enabling access to the promoter region for a range of transcription factors and the pre-initiation complex (PIC). The complex also plays a role in double-strand break and nucleotide excision repair mechanisms and in the decatenation of newly replicated sister chromatids, a requirement for proper chromosome segregation during mitosis. Also targeted to chromatin by phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate which promotes the complex binding to actin filaments. The complex additionally interacts with a range of nuclear receptors and the vitamin D receptor (VDR, P11473) via SMARCD subunits. Regulates cell differentiation in several lineages, such as T cells and myocytes, and specific variants exist in embryonic stem cells (esBAF) and neuronal progenitor cells (npBAF). Acts as transcriptional repressor of neuronal genes in non-neuronal cells by interacting with the REST repressor complex and histone deacetylases (HDACs). In this variant of the complex transcriptional repression is probably driven by the presence of the ARID1A subunit. The SWI/SNF complexes have been reported as consisting of 8 to 14 subunits. It is likely that the two ATPases, SMARCA2/BRM (CPX-1164) and SMARCA4/BRG1 (this complex) do not co-occur in the same complex. SMARCD1 (BAF60A) and SMARCD2 (BAF60B) also may not co-occur.

CPX-1216	Neuron-specific SWI/SNF ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex, ARID1A-SMARCA4 variant	An ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex which is recruited to tissue- and lineage-specific promoters and enhancers of target genes and then alters chromatin structure. The precise process is undefined but the complex appears to reduce the superhelicity of the promoter region DNA around nucleosomes and may produce short DNA loops that are detached from the the nucleosomes, enabling access to the promoter region for a range of transcription factors and the pre-initiation complex (PIC). The complex also plays a role in double-strand break and nucleotide excision repair mechanisms and in the decatenation of newly replicated sister chromatids, a requirement for proper chromosome segregation during mitosis. Also targeted to chromatin by phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate which promotes the complex binding to actin filaments. The complex additionally interacts with a range of nuclear receptors and the vitamin D receptor (VDR, P11473) via SMARCD subunits. The neuron-specific SWI/SNF complex is critical for the proliferation of post-mitotic neurons and regulates genes specific for dendritic growth by binding tightly with CREST (O75177). In this variant of the complex transcriptional repression is probably driven by the presence of the ARID1A subunit. During neural development a switch from a progenitor to a post-mitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. This process requires a switch of two subunits: ACTL6A (O96019) is replaced by ACTL6B and PHF10 (Q8WUB8) replaced by DPF1 or DPF3 in neuron-specific SWI/SNF complexes. The SWI/SNF complexes have been reported as consisting of 8 to 14 subunits.

CPX-122	Filamin A homodimer	Homodimeric actin cross-linking proteins that organize the actin cytoskeleton and maintain extracellular matrix connections by anchoring actin filaments to transmembrane receptors. By cross-linking and anchoring actin filaments, filamins stabilize the plasma membrane, provide cellular cortical rigidity, and contribute to the mechanical stability of the plasma membrane and the cell cortex. FLNa-actin networks behave as weak elastic solids under low shear stress due to the flexible nature of actin-FLNa crosslinks, yet can support large shear stresses and have pronounced nonlinear strain-stiffening behaviors. High avidity binding to F-actin due to dimerization and multiple binding to F-actin through FLNa ABD and rod 1 confers strain-stiffening on actin networks. FLNa dimers also interact with transmembrane proteins, cytoskeletal proteins, and intracellular signaling proteins and are therefore involved in stabilization and regulation of plasma membrane and intracellular signaling.

CPX-1229	RAP1-GCR1-GCR2 transcription activation complex	Transcription factor required for the transcription of glycolytic genes. Appears to simultaneously bind to two adjacent DNA elements (UAS(RPG) and the CT box, bound specifically by RAP1 and GCR1, respectively). The complex can activate transcription through isolated UAS(RPG) ((upstream activating sequence in ribosomal protein genes)) but not CT elements. CT box-dependent transcriptional activation requires GCR2. GCR2 is essential only for the expression of CT box-containing glycolytic genes, but not for ribosomal genes, which do not have a CT box. GCR2 tappears to induce a conformation change in GCR1 and/or stimulate its hyperphosphorylation.	GCR complex|GCR1/2/RAP1 complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:559292
CPX-123	Filamin A homodimer	Homodimeric actin cross-linking proteins that organize the actin cytoskeleton and maintain extracellular matrix connections by anchoring actin filaments to transmembrane receptors. By cross-linking and anchoring actin filaments, filamins stabilize the plasma membrane, provide cellular cortical rigidity, and contribute to the mechanical stability of the plasma membrane and the cell cortex. FLNa-actin networks behave as weak elastic solids under low shear stress due to the flexible nature of actin-FLNa crosslinks, yet can support large shear stresses and have pronounced nonlinear strain-stiffening behaviors. High avidity binding to F-actin due to dimerization and multiple binding to F-actin through FLNa ABD and rod 1 confers strain-stiffening on actin networks. FLNa dimers also interact with transmembrane proteins, cytoskeletal proteins, and intracellular signaling proteins and are therefore involved in stabilization and regulation of plasma membrane and intracellular signaling.

The complex also plays a role in double-strand break and nucleotide excision repair mechanisms and in the decatenation of newly replicated sister chromatids, a requirement for proper chromosome segregation during mitosis. Also targeted to chromatin by phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate which promotes the complex binding to actin filaments. The complex additionally interacts with a range of nuclear receptors and the vitamin D receptor (Vdr, P48281) via Smarcd subunits. Regulates cell differentiation in several lineages, such as T cells and myocytes, and specific variants exist in embryonic stem cells (esBAF) and neuronal progenitor cells (npBAF). Acts as transcriptional repressor of neuronal genes in non-neuronal cells by interacting with the REST repressor complex and histone deacetylases (HDACs). In this variant of the complex transcriptional activation is probably driven by the presence of the Arid1b subunit. Removes Polycomb repressive complex 1 and 2 (PRC1 & PRC2) resulting in promoter activation via deubiquitination of H2AK119 and demethylation of H3K27. Activates, among others, transcription of oestrogen-responsive genes, glucocorticoid receptor-dependent genes and genes activating the Notch-signalling pathway. The SWI/SNF complexes have been reported as consisting of 8 to 14 subunits. It is likely that the two ATPases, Smarca2/Brm (CPX-1238) and Smarca4/Brg1 (this complex) do not co-occur in the same complex. Smarcd1 (Baf60a) and Smarcd2 (Baf60b) also may not co-occur. The following proteins may be associated with SWI/SNF (BAF) complex variants, with one or more from each family present in any given complex: Dpf2/Baf45d (Q61103), Brd9 (Q3UQU0), Ss18 (Q62280), Bcl11a (Q9QYE3), Bcl11b (Q99PV8), Bcl7a (Q9CXE2), Bcl7b (Q921K9), BCL7C (O08664). Mutations in several subunits affect tissue and developmental processes such as nervous system and cardiac development and maintenance of pluripotency resulting in tumorigenesis or the development of intellectual disorders.

Each transport cycle comprises a sequence of conformational transitions that permit extracellular K+ ions to access the binding sites in phosphorylated pumps and cytoplasmic Na+ ions to access the sites after dephosphorylation . Binding of the third Na+ ion triggers autophosphorylation, and binding of the second K+ ion prompts auto-dephosphorylation. This coupling of alternating ion access to ATP hydrolysis ensures forward, energetically uphill, progress of the Na+/K+ transport cycle. The larger pumped Na+ efflux than K+ influx constitutes outward current, a direction tending to make the membrane potential more negative. However, because each step in the cycle is reversible , if the normally transported intracellular Na+ and extracellular K+ are both scarce, the cycle can run backward, thus synthesizing ATP and generating inward, depolarizing current. Variants containing ATP1A1-ATP1B1 appear to be most widely expressed.

CPX-1250	Polybromo-associated SWI/SNF ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex, ACTL6B variant	An ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex which is recruited to tissue- and lineage-specific promoters and enhancers of target genes and then alters chromatin structure. The precise process is undefined but the complex appears to reduce the superhelicity of the promoter region DNA around nucleosomes and may produce short DNA loops that are detached from the the nucleosomes, enabling access to the promoter region for a range of transcription factors and the pre-initiation complex (PIC). The complex also plays a role in double-strand break and nucleotide excision repair mechanisms and in the decatenation of newly replicated sister chromatids, a requirement for proper chromosome segregation during mitosis. Also targeted to chromatin by phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate which promotes the complex binding to actin filaments. The complex additionally interacts with a range of nuclear receptors and the vitamin D receptor (VDR, P48281) via Smarcd subunits. pBAF complexes facilitate the ligand-dependant transcriptional activation of target genes by nuclear hormone receptors and regulates cell differentiation, esp. in cardiac development. Acts as transcriptional repressor of neuronal genes in non-neuronal cells by interacting with the REST repressor complex and histone deacetylases (HDACs). The SWI/SNF complexes have been reported as consisting of 8 to 14 subunits. pBAF exists in two variants, containing either Actl6a (CPX-1248) or Actl6b (this complex) subunit. Subunit Brd7 may be restricted to pBAF complexes in embryonic stem cells and not present in differentiated cells. The alternative ATPase, Smarca2/Brm (Q6DIC0), does not occur in the pBAF complexes. Smarcd1 (Baf60a) and Smarcd2 (Baf60b) may not co-occur. It is not clear if Bcl7a (Q9CXE2), Bcl7b (Q921K9), Bcl7c (O08664) or Smarcd3 (Q6P9Z1) are part of any pBAF variants. Mutations in several subunits affect tissue and developmental processes such as nervous system and cardiac development and maintenance of pluripotency resulting in tumorigenesis or the development of intellectual disorders.

The complex additionally interacts with a range of nuclear receptors and the vitamin D receptor (Vdr, P48281) via Smarcd subunits. The embryonic stem cell-specific SWI/SNF complex is critical for self-renewal, maintenance and pluripotency of embryonic stem cells. The lack of subunit Arid1b suggests it primarily acts as a transcriptional repressor but also has the ability to activate some genes. The SWI/SNF complexes have been reported as consisting of 8 to 14 subunits. The embryonic stem cell-specific (esc-)SWI/SNF complex specifically lacks subunits Actl6b (Q99MR0), ARID1B (E9Q6R4), SMARCA2 (Q6DIC0), SMARCC2 (Q6PDG5) and SMARCD3 (Q6P9Z1). SMARCD2 (Q99JR8) may be present in esc-SWI/SNF complexes in which case it probably forms a variant, replacing SMARCD1. BCL7A, BCL7B and BCL7C have been shown to be part of the esc-SWI/SNF complex but may be mutually exclusive and therefore probably forms further variants. Mutations in several subunits affect tissue and developmental processes such as nervous system and cardiac development and maintenance of pluripotency resulting in tumorigenesis or the development of intellectual disorders.	embryonic stem cell-specific BAF ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling complex|embryonic stem cell-specific BAF complex|embryonic stem cell-specific BRG1-associated factors complex|embryonic stem cell-specific BRM-associated factors complex|embryonic stem cell-specific SWI/SNF ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex|embryonic stem cell-specific SWI/SNF ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling complex|embryonic stem cell-specific SWI/SNF complex|embryonic stem cell-specific SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable complex|embryonic stem cell-specific mSWI/SNF complex|es-SWI/SNF complex|esBAF complex|esc-SWI/SNF complex|escBAF complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:10090

The neural progenitor-specific SWI/SNF complex is critical for self-renewal, maintenance and pluripotency of neural progenitor stem cells by selectively activating or repressing its target genes. In this variant of the complex transcriptional repression is probably driven by the presence of the Arid1a subunit. During neural development a switch from a progenitor to a post-mitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. This process requires a switch of two subunits: Actl6a is replaced by Actl6b (Q99MR0) and PHF10 replaced by Dpf1 (Q9QX66) or Dpf3 (P58269) in neuron-specific SWI/SNF complexes. The SWI/SNF complexes have been reported as consisting of 8 to 14 subunits. Although similar in function to the embryonic stem cell-specific SWI/SNF complex the composition of the neural progenitor-specific SWI/SNF complexes is more similar to the standard SWI/SNF complexes.

CPX-126	Sodium:potassium-exchanging ATPase complex, FXYD2 variant	An ATPase-dependent transmembrane transport complex capable of generating electrochemical gradients by exchanging three intracellular sodium ions for two extracellular potassium ions during each cycle of ATP hydrolysis. Na+/K+ pumps can also generate an inward current of protons. Each transport cycle comprises a sequence of conformational transitions that permit extracellular K+ ions to access the binding sites in phosphorylated pumps and cytoplasmic Na+ ions to access the sites after dephosphorylation . Binding of the third Na+ ion triggers autophosphorylation, and binding of the second K+ ion prompts auto-dephosphorylation. This coupling of alternating ion access to ATP hydrolysis ensures forward, energetically uphill, progress of the Na+/K+ transport cycle. The larger pumped Na+ efflux than K+ influx constitutes outward current, a direction tending to make the membrane potential more negative. However, because each step in the cycle is reversible , if the normally transported intracellular Na+ and extracellular K+ are both scarce, the cycle can run backward, thus synthesizing ATP and generating inward, depolarizing current.

CPX-1260	SDS22-GLC7-YPI1 phosphatase complex	Protein phosphatase complex implicated in acting in opposition to the Chromosomal Passenger complex (CPX-1900) at the kinetochore. GLC7 dephosphorylation of kinetochore proteins promotes mitotic spindle attachment. The opposing Chromosomal Passenger complex and GLC7 activities ensure that chromosomes achieve a bipolar attachment to the spindle. SDS22 appears to both act as a targeting subunit for the enzyme and also to regulate phosphatase activity. YPI1 may target the complex to the nucleus and also act to maintain the complex in a largely inactive state, preventing inactivation of the spindle checkpoint.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:559292
CPX-1261	Brain-specific SWI/SNF ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex, ARID1A-SMARCA2 variant	An ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex which is recruited to tissue- and lineage-specific promoters and enhancers of target genes and then alters chromatin structure. The precise process is undefined but the complex appears to reduce the superhelicity of the promoter region DNA around nucleosomes and may produce short DNA loops that are detached from the the nucleosomes, enabling access to the promoter region for a range of transcription factors and the pre-initiation complex (PIC). The complex also plays a role in double-strand break and nucleotide excision repair mechanisms and in the decatenation of newly replicated sister chromatids, a requirement for proper chromosome segregation during mitosis. Also targeted to chromatin by phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate which promotes the complex binding to actin filaments. The complex additionally interacts with a range of nuclear receptors and the vitamin D receptor (Vdr, P48281) via Smarcd subunits. Regulates cell differentiation specifically in post-mitotic brain tissue. In this variant of the complex transcriptional repression is probably driven by the presence of the Arid1a subunit.

It is likely that the two ATPases, Smarca2/Brm (this complex) and Smarca4/Brg1 (CPX-1262) do not co-occur in the same complex.

CPX-1266	REG1-GLC7 phosphatase complex	Protein phosphatase complex with a role in glucose repression. REG1-GLC7 binds to SNF1 when the SNF1 kinase complex (CPX-232/CPX-2800/CPX-231) is activated by phosphorylation, which occurs at a much higher rate in glucose-limited cells than in glucose-grown cells. REG1-GLC7 facilitates the transition of the kinase complex back to an autoinhibited state, presumably by dephosphorylating SNF1.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:559292
CPX-1267	REG2-GLC7 phosphatase complex	Protein phosphatase complex with a role in theresponse to glucose levels. During steady-state growth in high glucose, the SNF1 kinase complex (CPX-232/CPX-2800/CPX-231) is inactive and REG2 is not expressed. Prolonged glucose starvation leads to SNF1-dependent accumulation of REG2. Once glucose becomes abundant, REG2-GLC7 contributes to the rapid dephosphorylation and inactivation of SNF1 which acts as a central regulator of cellular energy homeostasis.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:559292

The P protein (GCV2, P49095) binds the alpha-amino group of glycine through its pyridoxal phosphate cofactor; CO2 is released and the remaining methylamine moiety is then transferred to the lipoamide cofactor of the H protein (GV3, P39726).

The extensive interactions between the two proteins indicate that Telethonin provides a 'bridge' that anchors the ends of two different Titin molecules to the Z disk. There is evidence that Telethonin binding to Titin might be essential for the initial assembly, stabilization and functional integrity of the Titin filament and hence important for muscle contraction relaxation in mature myofibrils.

CPX-1273	Condensin I-like dosage compensation complex	Modulates chromosome and sex-specific gene expression.

CPX-129	LDLR-PCSK9 complex	The formation of the LDLR- PCSK9 complex at neutral pH promotes degradation of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) component, the major clearance route of circulating cholesterol through the endosome/lysosome pathway. Consequently, a reduction in the internalisation of circulating low density lipoproteins (LDLs) occurs, leading to high plasma levels of LDLs, causing familial hypercholesterolemia type 3.

CPX-1294	Mitochondrial ribonuclease P complex	Responsible for the 5' endonucleolytic cleavage of precursor tRNAs (pre-tRNAs) to remove approximately 12 leader nucleotides to yield mature tRNAs. The RNA subunit of the mitochondrial RNase P is most probably a catalytically active ribozyme that is capable of both recognizing and cleaving substrates efficiently and accurately. The protein component serves as an absolutely required cofactor.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:559292
CPX-1295	MKT1-PBP1 translation regulation complex	Translational regulation complex which modulates levels of the HO endonucease in the mother cells of budding yeast, enabling the cells to switch mating types.

CPX-1296	Urease activation complex	Facilitates the activation of urease. Involves the channeling of two nickel ions into the active site of urease. UREG is crucial for nickel delivery during urease activation.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:3702
CPX-1297	CPAP-STIL complex	A protein complex that is required for centriole biogenesis and duplication. During procentriole formation during G1/S transition, Plk4 (Q64702) activates STIL by phosphorylating its STAN domain, then activated Stil loads Sass6 and Cenpj (CPAP) to the base of the procentriole to initiate procentriole assembly. Together with Cep135 (Q6P5D4), Cenpj and Sass6 form the central scaffolding of the 9-fold symmetry of the procentriole. In the assembled centriole 9 homodimers of Sass6 form the central waggon wheel while Cep135 and Cenpj connect Sass6 to the microtubules. Lack of the complex or any of its subunits leads to a loss of centriole formation or spindle formation while overexpression leads to overly long centrioles. Patients with autosomal recessive primary microcephaly often present with aberrant spindle positioning in progenitor cells during brain development and mutations in Cenpj or Stil.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:10090
CPX-1298	CEP192-PLK4 complex	A protein complex essential for centriole biogenesis; temporarily part of the procentriole to which it recruits further proteins involved in procentriole formation.

CPX-130	ANXA2-PCSK9 complex	The formation of the AnxA2-PCSK9 complex reduces the degradation of the LDLR (low density lipoprotein receptor, P01130), leading to increased clearance of LDLs (low density lipoproteins). The reduced levels of circulating LDLs in plasma could lead to protection from coronary heart disease and premature atherosclorosis.

CPX-1302	OPY2-MSB2 osmosensory complex	Osmosensor that activates the HOG1 mitogen-activated protein kinase (P32485), which regulates diverse osmoadaptive responses. Increased external osmolarity induces conformational changes in the complex formed between the Hkr1-Msb2 homology (HMH) domain of MSB2 and the cysteine-rich region of OPY2. This conformational change is transmitted across the plasma membrane to induce an interaction between the associated STE20 (Q03497) and STE11 (P23561) protein kinases, thus activating a signal cascade which culminates in HOG1 activation.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:559292
CPX-1303	MST27-MST28 vesicle formation complex	Role in promoting vesicle formation. Appears to provide nucleation sites, which recruit and locally concentrate cytosolic coat complexes onto the membranes of the early secretory pathway.

Remodels the mRNA ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) from nuclear to cytoplasmic specificity. mif4gd subunit interacts with the eIF4F complex, the cytoplasmic cap-binding complex that binds the 5-prime histone mRNA cap. eIF4F complex binding facilitates the circularisation of hmRNA that is required for its translation. Acts exclusively during G1/S transition when histones are in greatest demand. Both the complex and hmRNA are degraded at the end of S phase when Thr-80 and Thr-81 of slbp are phosphorylated (as shown in human ortholog). Translation of histones during other cell phases cause defects and can be toxic to the cell.	SLBP-MIF4GDB complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:7955
CPX-1306	Nascent polypeptide-associated complex, EGD1-EGD2 variant	Reversibly binds to cytoplasmic ribosomes and interacts with nascent polypeptides emerging from the ribosome to prevent them from incorrect interactions, thus controlling the early protein folding processes and preventing aggregation or degradation of newly synthesized proteins. The EGD1-EGD2 variant appears to be the dominant form of the complex formed in vivo and has a preference for ribosomes translating metabolic enzymes as well as secretory and membrane proteins. By binding to the first 30-50 amino acids to be translated, the complex prevents mitochondrial precursor proteins synthesized in the cytosol from forming a basic, amphipathic helix. This enables this targeting sequence to first bind to chaperones and mitochondrial import stimulating factors and then to the outer membrane translocase complex (CPX-474) on the mitochondrial surface.

CPX-131	HCN4 channel complex	Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) ion channel that is dually activated by hyperpolarization and binding of cAMP to their cyclic nucleotide binding domain (CNBD) thereby releasing the tonic inhibition exerted by the cytoplasmic CNBD on the channel pore. Exhibits weak selectivity for potassium over sodium ions and contributes to the native pacemaker currents in heart (If) and possibly in neurons (Ih). Together with HCN2 (Q9UL51, CPX-143), HCN4 is the dominant form of HCN expressed in the heart, especially in the sinoatrial node. Contrary to other ion-gated channels, HCN channels do not require an accessory unit but depolarisation activity is affected by optional accessory proteins such as TRIP8b (PEX5L, Q8IYB4). Mutations in the C-terminus containing the C-linker and CNBD domain, which affect the expression or function of the HCN4 channel, are known to cause arrhythmia or bradycardia or lipids such as phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate.

CPX-1314	bI4 intron splicing factor complex	Self-splicing ribozymal RNA Group I intron splicing factor for mitochondrial introns. A guanosine cofactor docks onto an active G-binding site and hydrolyses the phosphodiester bond at the splice site located in P1, resulting in a free hydroxyl group at the upstream exon and the guanosine cofactor being attached to the 5-prime end of the intron. Then the terminal guanosine of the intron occupies the G-binding site to organize the second ester-transfer reaction leading to the ligation of the adjacent upstream and downstream exons and release of the catalytic intron.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:559292
CPX-1315	Nonsense-mediated decay complex	Recognizes and elicits the rapid degradation of mRNAs that prematurely terminate translation and also regulates the expression of specific genes by degrading natural mRNAs. Nonsence-mediated decay (NMD) is triggered by the messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) context surrounding the translation termination event. NMD targets can be recognized as targets due to the lack of factors bound downstream from the termination codon. A ribosome terminating translation at a termination codon substantially upstream from the poly(A) tail terminates translation inefficiently. NMD may occur because the PAB1 (P04147) or other factor bound to the poly(A) tail is not in close enough proximity to the terminating ribosome to enable interaction of the PAB1 with SUP35 (P05453), which is bound to the terminating ribosome and thus establishes the correct mRNP context for a normal translation termination event. In the absence of correct translation termination, the nonsense-mediated decay complex interacts with the translation release factor ERF1-ERF3 complex (CPX-435), resulting in an aberrant translation termination event and NMD activation. NMD activation leads to the decapping of the mRNA by the decapping complex, DCP1-DCP2 (CPX-1628), followed by 5-prime to 3-prime degradation of the mRNA by the exoribonuclease XRN1 (P22147).

May also include some mRNAs as substrates. NRD1 and NAB3 recognize and bind to specific motifs on the nascent RNA (GUAA/G and UCUUG respectively) NRD1 additionally interacts with phosphoryated Ser-5 of the C-terminal domain of the largest subunit of RNAPII (CPX-2662). This positions SEN1 onto the nascent RNA in close proximity to RNAPII and the complex translocates along the RNA causing dismantling of the elongation complex (ternary complexes composed of the transcribing RNA polymerase, the DNA template and the nascent RNA) in a reaction that requires the action of the helicase domain of SEN1.

CPX-1322	RAD53-ASF1 complex	Role in recovery from the DNA damage checkpoint. ASF1 binds most of the free and unmodified RAD53 in the cell and this is required for complete dephosphorylation of Rad53 when the upstream DNA damage checkpoint signaling is turned off. Phosphorylation of RAD53 following DNA damage causes dissociation and frees RAD53 to undergo autophosphorylation and activation and to participate in double-strand break repair.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:559292
CPX-1323	CDC48-RAD23-UFD2 complex	A type II AAA ATPase that is involved in the dislocation/extraction step of its substrate proteins from cellular structures or multiprotein complexes into the cytosol where they are largely degraded by the proteasome.. Role in the escort pathway of proteasomal protein degradation, linking the ubiquitylation of specific substrates directly to their delivery to the proteasome. Oligo-ubiquitylated substrates are recognized and extracted by CDC48. UFD2 modifies the client proteins with lys-48-linked chains of four to six ubiquitins. RAD23 is recruited to the ternary complex, in which its UBL domain associates with UFD2, and then CDC48 remodels the complex to release the RAD23-ubiquitylated substrate complex which binds to the proteasome and delivers the substrate for degradation.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:559292

Importin-complex-bound CBC gets reimported into the nucleus for reuse. Modulates ABA signaling by altering transcript of early ABA signaling elements and function as negative regulators in guard cell ABA signaling. Mutations in either subunit result in slow growth, serrated leaf margins, ABA hypersensitivity and greater resistance to draught.

CPX-134	RISC-loading complex, TARBP2 variant	Binds to precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs). DICER then cleaves approximately 22 nucleotides from the 5' end of the stem-loop to form mature double-stranded miRNAs. The duplex miRNA is then loaded onto Argonaute (AGO) proteins which, with the scaffolding proteins TNRC6, form the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). During this loading process, the passenger strand is removed from the RNA duplex leaving the guide strand. May also process pre-siRNAs.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606
CPX-1340	Separase-Securin complex	Regulates the metaphase-to-anaphase transition during cell cycle progression, playing a role in control of the metaphase-anaphase transition and anaphase onset. Complex formation both activates and inhibits the protease activity of separase which is responsible for cleaving the MCD1/SCC1 (Q12158) subunit of the cohesin ring that holds sister chromatids together during mitosis.

CPX-1408	Nuclear meiotic cohesin complex	Required for sister chromatid cohesion during meiotic cell division, which enables cells to attach sister kinetochores to microtubules with opposing polarity (bi-orientation) and subsequently resists the tendency of these microtubules to pull chromatids toward opposite spindle poles. Before the commencement of replication, the cohesin complex is loaded onto DNA. The arms of the SMC1/3 molecules embrace the DNA, thereby forming a ring of approx. 40 nm diameter. The head domains of SMC1 and SMC3 are locked together by REC8. Cohesion might be generated as the replication fork passes through the ring, entrapping both sister chromatids inside. At the metaphase to anaphase transition, REC8 is cleaved by separase, thereby opening the lock of the SMC1/3 head domains. The ring opens and sister chromatids can be pulled to opposite spindle poles. REC8 is required to efficiently recruit meiotic axis proteins such as RED1 and evenly distribute these along the meiotic chromosomes.	Cohesin complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:559292

Complex formation both activates and inhibits the protease activity of separase/sep-1 which is responsible for cleaving the scc-1 (Q19325) subunit of the cohesin ring that holds sister chromatids together during mitosis. Securin/ify-1 appears to ensure that separase adopts its proper fold required for proteolytic activity and also promotes subcellular localization of separase to the nucleus. Securin is degraded via ubiquitylation by the anaphase-promoting complex enabling separase to become fully active.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:6239

CPX-1418	Spliceosomal commitment complex	Formation of this complex is the first defined step in the yeast splicing pathway and is responsible for intron recognition, which targets pre-mRNA to the splicing pathway. Binding of the 5-prime end of U1 snRNP (CPX-23) to the 5-prime splice site through base-pairing forms first a basal complex only dependent on a 5-prime splice site (CC1) and then a more stable second complex dependent on a branchpoint as well as a 5-prime splice site region (CC2). Interactions between the BBP-MUD2 branchpoint-binding complex (CPX-1417) and the U1 snRNP protein PRP40 (P33203) defines a bridge between the two ends of the intron. PRP5 may interact with U1 snRNP and other proteins to bridge the 5' splice site and the UACUAACA box of the pre-mRNA's branchpoint region. It may also recruit U2 snRNP (CPX-26) which binds to the intron branch site of the commitment complex to form the pre-spliceosome in an ATP dependent step.	CC		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:559292

CPX-142	HCN2 channel complex	Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) ion channel that is dually activated by hyperpolarization and binding of cAMP to their cyclic nucleotide binding domain (CNBD) thereby releasing the tonic inhibition exerted by the cytoplasmic CNBD on the channel pore. Exhibits weak selectivity for potassium over sodium ions and contributes to the native pacemaker currents in heart (If) and in neurons (Ih). Together with HCN4 (O70507, CPX-139), HCN2 is the dominant form of HCN expressed in the heart. Produces a large instantaneous current. Modulated by intracellular chloride ions and pH; acidic pH shifts the activation to more negative voltages. Contrary to other ion-gated channels, HCN channels do not require an accessory unit but depolarisation activity is affected by optional accessory proteins such as TRIP8b (Pex5l, Q8C437) or lipids such as phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate.

Newly synthesized PIKK interacts with TEL2, in the TEL2-TTI1-TTI2 complex assisted by HSP90 (P02829). Phosphorylated TEL2 then appears to mediate the interaction between PIKK and R2TP complex to eventually lead to the proper assembly of PIKK.	TEL2 complex|TTT complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:559292
CPX-1423	COX1 pre-assembly complex	Binds to and stabilizes COX1 (P00401) during the assembly of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV/cytochrome C oxidase (CPX-1721/CPX-1722). The process is probably catalyzed by assembly chaperones such as SHY1 (P53266) and COA1 (P40452). The complex also acts to trap the COX1-mRNA-specific translational activator, MSS51, thus rendering it incompetent to support translation of COX1. On further maturation of the assembly intermediate, MSS51 dissociates and can stimulate further rounds of COX1 mRNA translation.	COA complex D5		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:559292

The myosin heavy chain motor domain mediates the ATP-dependent interaction with the F-actin cytoskeleton. The myosin neck region with the bound light chains acts as a rigid lever arm that amplifies movements within the myosin motor domain into a large mechanical stroke that directionally propels the myosin along the actin filament.

CPX-1427	Nuclear cap-binding complex	Binds co-transcriptionally to the 5-prime, m7GpppG-cap (m7G-cap) structures of all RNA polymerase II transcripts (pre-mRNAs and pre-miRNAs).

During the pioneer round of translation it interacts with CTIF (O43310) which facilitates the eventual release of CBC from the transcript and its replacement by the cytoplasmic cap-binding complex eIF4F. In the cytosol, importin-beta interacts with CBC-bound importin-alpha and promotes the dissociation of the RNA from CBC. Importin-complex-bound CBC gets reimported into the nucleus for reuse. NCBP1 phosphorylation correlate with increased cap-dependent splicing activity. Histone pre-mRNA processing and the pioneer round of translation may be restricted to mammalian CBC.

CPX-146	SMAD1-SMAD4 complex 	A transcription factor complex which binds to the promoters of target genes and recruits co-activators and histone acetyltransferases, such as p300, CBP and P300/CBP-associated factor, facilitating transcription. In response to TGF-beta/activin-family protein binding, primarily BMP (bone morphogenetic proteins), TGF-beta type II receptors phosphorylate TGF-beta type I receptors (ALK1, 2, 3 and 6) which in turn phosphorylates SMAD1 on Ser-463 and Ser-465. This enables binding to SMAD4 to form heteromeric SMAD complexes that enter the nucleus to initiate gene transcription. Because of their relatively low DNA-binding affinity, SMAD complexes interact with a wide variety of DNA-binding proteins. Crosstalk with other signalling pathways and interaction with other DNA-binding cofactors define the specific binding patterns of SMADs; in addition, interaction with coactivators/corepressors modulates their transcriptional activity.

CPX-1470	Myosin class I complex, MYO5 variant	Responsible for endocytic internalization. Required for proper actin cytoskeleton assembly polarization via the formation of actin patches. The myosin heavy chain motor domain mediates the ATP-dependent interaction with the F-actin cytoskeleton. The myosin neck region with the bound light chains acts as a rigid lever arm that amplifies movements within the myosin motor domain into a large mechanical stroke that directionally propels the myosin along the actin filament. The C-terminal extension (long-tail) of Myosin-5 can trigger Arp2/3 complex (CPX-607)-dependent actin polymerization.	Myosin class 1 complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:559292

CPX-15	CST complex	RPA-like (replication protein A) complex, that has high affinity for telomeric ssDNA. The complex is assembled during late S-G2 and is involved in capping, and thus protecting, single stranded telomeric DNA and preventing chromosomal damage by inhibiting telomerase activity. Plays a role in the regulation of the synthesis of C strand via its interaction with polymerase alpha primase.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:559292
CPX-150	GLI3-SUFU complex	Transcriptional modulator complex, the formation of which regulates the activity of GLI transcription factors. Role as a negative regulator of the hedgehog-signalling network and plays a fundamental role in the control of development, cell proliferation and differentiation.

CPX-1500	Myosin class I complex, MYO3 variant	Responsible for endocytic internalization. Required for proper actin cytoskeleton assembly polarization via the formation of actin patches. The myosin heavy chain motor domain mediates the ATP-dependent interaction with the F-actin cytoskeleton. The myosin neck region with the bound light chains acts as a rigid lever arm that amplifies movements within the myosin motor domain into a large mechanical stroke that directionally propels the myosin along the actin filament. The C-terminal extension (long-tail) of Myosin-5 can trigger Arp2/3 complex (CPX-607)-dependent actin polymerization.	Myosin class 1 complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:559292
CPX-1501	Myosin class V complex, MYO4 variant	Building block of the class V myosin processive molecular motor involved in a range of organelle-transporting functions, including the transport of vacuoles and mRNA. The myosin heavy chain motor domain mediates the ATP-dependent interaction with the F-actin cytoskeleton. The myosin neck region with the bound light chains acts as a rigid lever arm that amplifies movements within the myosin motor domain into a large mechanical stroke that directionally propels the myosin along the actin filament. Myosin V has a high duty cycle, i.e. remains attached to actin for a large fraction of the mechanochemical cycle due to the slow rate of ADP release, the rate-limiting step in the ATPase cycle. This kinetic adaptation allows myosin V to take multiple steps without dissociating from the actin filament. Myosin V can take large steps of approximately 36nm, a distance equal to the helical repeat of the actin filament allowing Myosin V to walk in a straight line on the actin filament, in a hand-over-hand fashion.

CPX-154	Bub1-Bub3 complex	Present throughout the cell cycle, this complex promotes spindle assembly checkpoint signalling. The spindle checkpoint ensures accurate chromosome segregation by sending a signal from an unattached kinetochore to inhibit anaphase onset. BUB3 localizes and binds to to kinetochore protein SPC105 via its phosphorylated MELT motif (a motif conforming to the consensus M-[E/D]-[L/I/V/M]-T). The presence of BUB1 positively contributes to the interaction by reducing the BUB3-SPC105 binding affinity.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:559292

CPX-16	Cardiac troponin complex	Regulates contraction-relaxation cycles in response to changes in intracellular calcium. Together with tropomyosin, cTn is generally located along polymerised actin, which forms the backbone of the cardiomyocyte thin filament. At resting levels of intracellular calcium, the cTn complex keeps tropomyosin in a position that prevents force-producing interactions between myosin heads and actin. When the muscle cell is stimulated to contract by an action potential, calcium channels open in the sarcoplasmic membrane and release calcium into the sarcoplasm. Some of this calcium binds to specific sites in the N-domain of TnC, triggering a series of protein structural changes and tropomyosin is rolled away from myosin-binding sites on actin, allowing myosin to attach to the thin filament and produce force and/or shorten the sarcomere of the cardiomyocyte.	cTn|cTnC:cTnI:cTnT		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:10090

Component of the Pol II preinitiation complex. The TFIIH subunit XPB is an ATP-dependent translocase that promotes DNA strand separation and promoter escape. During the transition from initiation to promoter clearance, the kinase subunit Kin28 phosphorylates Ser-5 and Ser-7 within the Pol II carboxyl terminal domain (CTD). This phosphorylation initiates a cascade of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events on the CTD that correlates with dissociation of Pol II from the initiation machinery and its association with elongation and mRNA processing factors. This is the only general transcription factor with enzyme activity. During nucleotide excision repair, TFIIH is required for opening DNA around lesions that disrupt base pairing to permit excision of the damaged DNA and its replacement by a new DNA fragment.

CPX-166	Dehydrodolichyl diphosphate synthase complex variant SRT1	One of two complexes involved in dolichol synthesis. An essential part of the dolichol monophosphate biosynthetic machinery; creates dehydrodolichyl diphosphate (Dedol-PP), a precursor of dolichol, by adding multiple isopentenyl pyrophosphates (IPP) to farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP). Predominate product is 17-19 IPP units.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:559292
CPX-1660	General transcription factor complex TFIIK	Protein kinase component of transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) which phosphorylates the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II during transition from transcription to elongation after preinitiation complex (PIC) formation, thereby positively regulating transcription. TFIIH is essential for both basal and activated transcription, and is involved in nucleotide excision repair of damaged DNA. It is unclear whether this module has a role independent of that as a sub-complex of TFIIH.	Kin28p complex|TFIIK complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:559292
CPX-1661	SPT4-SPT5 transcription elongation factor complex	An essential RNA polymerase II elongation factor which functions in the control of RNAP II processivity. Mediates both activation and inhibition of transcription elongation, and plays a role in pre-mRNA processing. This complex seems to be important for the stability of the RNA polymerase II elongation machinery on the chromatin template but not for the inherent ability of this machinery to translocate down the gene. Binds RNA in a sequence-specific manner by recognizing multiple AA repeat sequences and a region within the conserved NusG N-terminal (NGN) domain of SPT5 contacts the non-template strand of DNA both upstream of RNAPII and in the transcription bubble.	5,6-Dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole sensitivity inducing factor complex|DRB sensitivity inducing factor complex|DSIF complex|Elongation Factor Spt4/5|Spt4-Spt5 heterodimer		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:559292
CPX-1662	Negative cofactor 2 transcriptional regulator complex	Represses RNA polymerase II transcription through binding to SPT15/TBP and thereby inhibiting the assembly of the preinitiation complex. The NC2 complex may also mediate transcriptional activation from TATA-driven promoters through association with SPT15/TBP and may form a larger, DNA-dependent, assembly with the Mot1-TBP complex (CPX-1141).

CPX-1663	CYC8-TUP1 corepressor complex	Role in the repression of many genes in a wide variety of physiological processes including heme-regulated and catabolite repressed genes. May also be involved in the derepression of at least some target genes. The complex is recruited to target genes by interaction with DNA-bound transcriptional repressors, like MATALPHA2, MIG1, RFX1 and SKO1. The complex recruits histone deacetylases to produce a repressive chromatin structure, interacts with hypoacetylated N-terminal tails of histones H3 and H4 that have been programmed for repression by the action of histone deacetylases, and interferes directly with the transcriptional machinery by associating with the RNA polymerase II mediator complex. Undergoes transient hyperosmotic stress-induced SUMOylation and inclusion formation, which are important for the regulation of hyperosmotic-stress genes, for example the activation of glycerol biosynthesis genes.

CPX-1664	DNA-directed RNA Polymerase I complex	Catalyzes the transcription of ribosomal RNA from a DNA template by acting as a nucleotidyl transferase that polymerizes ribonucleotides at the 3' end of an RNA transcript synthesizing precursors of rRNAs. Forms inactive dimers whereas initiation-competent Pol I is monomeric. Initiation of transcription requires the assembly of the upstream activating factor (UAF, CPX-1101), the core factor (CPX-1836), the TATA binding protein SPT15, and RNAP-I with RRN3 on the upstream element and core promoter. Upon transcription initiation, UAF, RRN3 and CF dissociate from the promoter.	Pol I|RNA polymerase A complex|RNAPI complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:559292

Required for DNA mismatch repair (MMR), correcting base-base mismatches and insertion-deletion loops resulting from DNA replication, DNA damage or from recombination events between non-identical sequences during meiosis. ATP binding induces a conformational change in the MSH2-MSH6 (CPX-1037) and MSH2-MSH3 (CPX-1036) complexes which converts these to a clamp form that slides along the DNA and leads to recruitment of MutLalpha, MutLbeta (CPX-1667) and MLH1-MLH3 (CPX-1668). Plays a major role in maintaining the genetic stability of simple sequence repeats, by suppressing recombination between slightly divergent or homeologous DNA sequences, and in the repair of heteroduplex sites present in meiotic recombination intermediates. The MLH1-PMS1 heterodimer acts as the major Mlh heterodimer in MMR and is thought to coordinate Msh-DNA binding with downstream repair factors.

This complex has been proposed to be an accessory factor that acts in conjunction with MLH1-PMS1 (CPX-1666) in maintaining the genetic stability of simple sequence repeats, by suppressing recombination between slightly divergent or homeologous DNA sequences, and in the repair of heteroduplex sites present in meiotic recombination intermediates. It may play a role in regulating between different crossover pathways.	MLH1-MLH2 heterodimer|MLH1/MLH2 complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:559292

ATP binding induces a conformational change in the MSH2-MSH6 (CPX-1037) and MSH2-MSH3 (CPX-1036) complexes which converts these to a clamp form that slides along the DNA and leads to recruitment of MutLalpha (CPX-1666), MutLbeta (CPX-1667) and MLH1-MLH3. Appears to substitute in a minor way MutLalpha, for maintaining the genetic stability of simple sequence repeats, by suppressing recombination between slightly divergent or homeologous DNA sequences, and in the repair of heteroduplex sites present in meiotic recombination intermediates.

CPX-167	Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor complex, 3xalpha4-2xbeta2	A ligand-gated ion channel receptor complex that is sensitive to endogenous achetylcholine and exogenous nicotinic agents. Ligand binding causes a conformational change of the receptor resulting in the formation of a pore that is permeable to Na+ and/or Ca2+ (inward) and K+ (outward) thereby depolarising the neuron. Mediates fast, short-lived, mainly pre-synaptic transmission of neurotransmitters. Major receptor in Central Nervous System and predominantly found in cerebellum, cortex, forebrain, hippocampus, mesencephalon, striatum, superior colliculus and thalamus. Up-regulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines, for example TNF-alpha.	ionotropic acetylcholine receptor complex|neuronal acetylcholine receptor; alpha4-beta2|neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine-gated cation channel complex|neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine-gated ion channel complex|neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine-gated receptor complex|neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine-gated receptor-channel complex|neuronal nicotinic cholinergic receptor complex, alpha4-beta2		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:10090
CPX-1670	MUS81-MMS4 structure-specific endonuclease complex	Structure-specific endonuclease that plays an important role in rescuing stalled replication forks and resolving the mitotic recombination intermediates. Has a substrate preference for branched DNA structures with a 5-prime end at the branch nick with cleavage probably occurring approximately half a helical turn upstream of the free 5-prime end. Resolves the four-way Holliday junction (HJ) in which the two recombining DNAs are covalently-linked junctions in crossover formation during meiotic recombination, however, its ability to cut intact HJs was found to be very limited in comparison with other structures, suggesting that a HJ precursor (such as a nicked HJ) might be its preferred DNA substrate. In mitotic cells, the activity of MUS81-MMS4 is low during S-phase, but phosphorylation of the MMS4 leads to complex activation at the onset of mitosis by the collaborative actions of two cell cycle kinases: CDC28 (P00546) and CDC5 (P32562).

Maintains proper vacuole morphology in vacuole delivery pathways by regulating fusion of vesicles with the vacuole at the tethering/docking stage. Regulates the SNARE complex during the coordinated priming and docking stages of fusion. May play a role in early-to-late endosome conversion. Mon1 interacts with Rab5 family GTPases and phosphatidylinositol phosphate lipids to recruit the complex to endosomes.

Play a role in cytokinesis, assembling early in the cell cycle as a patch at the incipient bud site and forming a ring approximate 15 minutes before bud emergence, which transforms into an hour-glass shaped collar of cortical filaments that spans both sides of the mother-bud neck. This collar persists until just before cytokinesis, when it splits into two rings that occupy opposite sides of the neck. The septins at the bud neck serve as a structural scaffold that recruits different components involved in diverse processes at specific stages during the cell cycle. Septins are also involved in cell morphogenesis, bud site selection, chitin deposition, cell cycle regulation, cell compartmentalization and spore wall formation.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:559292

Once activated, translocates to the nucleus where it phosphorylates an unknown protein to dislodge CDC14 (Q00684) from NET1 (P47035), resulting in diffusion of CDC14 throughout the nucleus. Phosphorylates CDC14 on several sites that flank the C-terminal nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequences, thereby inhibiting the NLS. Because of this, phosphorylated CDC14 molecules that escape to the cytoplasm cannot efficiently return to the nucleus and dephosphorylate substrates such as CDH1 (P53197) and SWI5 (P08153).

Acts as a reverse transcriptase that adds simple sequence repeats to chromosome ends by copying a template sequence within the RNA component of the enzyme. Catalyzes the RNA-dependent extension of 3'-chromosomal termini with the 6-nucleotide telomeric repeat unit, 5'-TTAGGG-3'. The catalytic cycle involves primer binding, primer extension and release of product once the template boundary has been reached or nascent product translocation followed by further extension. Overexpressed telomerase results in telomere lengthening which may lead to cell immortalization and cancer cell pathogenesis.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606

CPX-180	HipBA toxin-antitoxin complex	Type II toxin-antitoxin (TA) system formed by the toxin (hipA), and the antitoxin (hipB). TA systems act as effectors of dormancy and persistence, with the toxin causing growth arrest by interfering with a vital cellular process, such as transcription, translation or DNA replication, and the cognate antitoxin neutralizing the toxin activity during normal growth conditions. The protein kinase HipA acts as a persistence factor, inducing multi-drug tolerance by triggering growth arrest. HipA activity is inhibited upon binding to HipB through sequestration to the nucleoid and binding to DNA. Under conditions of stress the antitoxins are selectively degraded by cellular proteases such as Lon (P0A9M0) and ClpXP (CPX-3176), leaving the toxins to exert their effectsl which result in growth arrest and cell dormancy. Both the antitoxin and, in most cases, the TA complex bind the TA promoter to repress transcription, with TA complexes repressing transcription more efficiently than the antitoxins alone by increasing the co-operativity of antitoxin binding to operators. Complex formation prevents the protein kinase HipA acting as a persistence factor, inducing multi-drug tolerance by triggering growth arrest.

CPX-181	Inward rectifying potassium channel complex, Kir6.2-SUR2A	Weak inwards rectifying plasma membrane channel complex that facilitated the influx of potassium ions in an ATP- and MgADP-dependent manner and results in membrane hyperpolarisation and shortened action potentials. Activated by binding of MgADP or MgATP to the nucleotide binding domains (NBD) of the ABCC9/SUR2A subunit as well as extracellular K+ binding to the KCNJ11/Kir6.2 subunit. If MgATP binds it must first get hydrolised by the ATP hydrolysis activity of the NBD which also generates PtdIns(4,5)P2 from phosphatidylinositol. Channel activation possibly driven by conformational changes resulting from MgADP binding to SUR subunits and reducing ATP affinity to Kir6.2. Inhibited by intracellular ATP or ADP, Mg2+ and polyamines that bind to the Kir6.2 subunits. ATP/ADP probably changes the conformation of Kir6.2 while Mg2+ and polyamines physically block the flow of K+ through the channel pore. Also inhibited by exogenous sulfonylureas by binding to intracellular loops (possibly by displacing MgADP from NBDs). As ATP is a weak inhibitor Kir6.2 channels can open spontaneously and are classified as constitutively active ion channels. In the absence of ATP (but presence of MgATP), cardiac channels exhibit spontaneous bursts of rapid openings and closings (fast kinetics), which are separated by long closed intervals (slow kinetics). Conversely, ATP destabilizes channel open state and stabilizes its closed states by increasing the speed of gating. Found predominantly in cardiac smooth muscle, skeletal muscle smooth muscle, neurons and ovaries. Gating of the atrial K+ channel is mechanosensitive, and mechanical pressure applied to a cardiac cell leads to an increase in their activity.

CPX-1831	Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 core complex	Orchestrates several crucial steps in the translation initiation pathway. eIF3, eIF2 (CPX-427), eIF5, and eIF1 bind to each other to form a multifactor complex (MFC) which then binds to the 40S ribosome to form the 43S preinitiation complex. Thus formed, 43S preinitiation complex binds to mRNA to form 48S PIC and scans the mRNA leader region for the start codon. In addition to the five core subunits, yeast eIF3 complex has a loosely associated subunit, namely, Hcr1 (eIF3j/Q05775). This protein promotes the binding of eIF3 to the ribosome and is involved in ribosomal biogenesis as well as proper selection of the AUG start site.	eIF-3 core complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:559292
CPX-1832	tRNA-intron endonuclease complex	Catalyzes the first step of tRNA splicing, cleaving the splice sites of all the intron-containing pre-tRNAs, either in the nucleus or on the mitochondrial surface after their export out of the nucleus. The products are an intron and two tRNA half-molecules bearing 2',3' cyclic phosphate and 5'-OH termini. There are no conserved sequences at the splice sites, but the intron is invariably located at the same site in the gene, placing the splice sites an invariant distance from the constant structural features of the tRNA body.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:559292
CPX-1833	SEC61 protein-conducting channel complex	Cotranslational protein conducting channel (PCC) that also assembles with the Sec62-Sec63 complex (CPX-3056) to form the post-translational translocon complex (CPX-3055). Transports secretory proteins across, and inserts integral membrane proteins into, the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. The ribosome with an emerging signal sequence is targeted to the membrane by the signal recognition particle (CPX-609) and its receptor. The Sec61 complex acts as a receptor for the ribosome via its cytosolic loops. The alignment of the ribosomal tunnel with a central pore of the PCC allows direct movement of the nascent chain from the ribosomal tunnel exit across or into the membrane. The SEC61 channel appears to be responsible for the transport of glycoproteins. Binds to the oligosaccharyl transferase complex variant 2 (CPX-1639) which selectively glycosylates nascent polypeptide chains in the endoplasmic reticulum.

The ribosome with an emerging signal sequence is targeted to the membrane by the signal recognition particle (SRP) and its receptor. The Ssh1 complex acts as a receptor for the ribosome via its cytosolic loops. The alignment of the ribosomal tunnel with a central pore of the PCC allows direct movement of the nascent chain from the ribosomal tunnel exit across or into the membrane. The SSH1 translocon complex does not appear to be required for the transport of glycoproteins (see SEC61 translocon complex, CPX-1833).

Contributes to nutrition homeostasis and damage control in eukaryotic cells. Acts as an E3-like ligase. This activity is dependent on ATP and two enzymes, ATG7 (P38862) an E1-like activating enzyme and ATG10 (Q07879) an E2-like conjugating enzyme. Required for lipidation of ATG8 (P38182) (e.g. to phosphatidylethanolamine) and associates with the vesicle membranes once bound to ATG16 (CPX-1849).	APG12-APG5 complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:559292
CPX-1849	ATG12-ATG5-ATG16 complex	Essential for autophagy during nutrient deprivation, a catabolic process that sequesters undesired cellular material into autophagosomes for delivery to lysosomes for degradation. Functions as an E3-like enzyme in the ATG8 conjugation system. The ATG12-ATG5-ATG16 complex targets the autophagic membrane via the ATG5-ATG16 complex moiety and then recruits an ATG3:ATG8 thioester intermediate via the interaction between ATG3 and ATG12. The ATG12-ATG5 (CPX-1848) conjugate facilitates the transfer reaction of ATG8 from ATG3 to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) through a reorganization of the catalytic centre of the E2-like enzyme ATG3. The C-terminal glycine of ATG8 is then conjugated to the amine moiety of PE. The role of ATG16, which has no E3-like activity appears to be to target the ATG12-ATG5 conjugate to the autophagic membranes. ATG8-PE/ATG12-ATG5 complexes form homogeneous oligomers, comprising two to four subunits. ATG16 may then act to reorganize ATG8-PE/ATG12-ATG5 oligomers to form a continuous, flat protein layer with meshwork-like architecture on membranes.

CPX-185	Inward rectifying potassium channel complex, Kir6.2-SUR2B	Weak inwards rectifying plasma membrane channel complex that facilitated the influx of potassium ions in an ATP- and MgADP-dependent manner and results in membrane hyperpolarisation and shortened action potentials. Activated by binding of MgADP or MgATP to the nucleotide binding domains (NBD) of the ABCC9/SUR2B subunit as well as extracellular K+ binding to the KCNJ11/Kir6.2 subunit. If MgATP binds it must first get hydrolised by the ATP hydrolysis activity of the NBD which also generates PtdIns(4,5)P2 from phosphatidylinositol. Channel activation possibly driven by conformational changes resulting from MgADP binding to SUR subunits and reducing ATP affinity to Kir6.2. Inhibited by intracellular ATP or ADP, Mg2+ and polyamines that bind to the Kir6.2 subunits. ATP/ADP probably changes the conformation of Kir6.2 while Mg2+ and polyamines physically block the flow of K+ through the channel pore. Also inhibited by exogenous sulfonylureas by binding to intracellular loops (possibly by displacing MgADP from NBDs). As ATP is a weak inhibitor Kir6.2 channels can open spontaneously and are classified as constitutively active ion channels. In the absence of ATP (but presence of MgATP), cardiac channels exhibit spontaneous bursts of rapid openings and closings (fast kinetics), which are separated by long closed intervals (slow kinetics). Conversely, ATP destabilizes channel open state and stabilizes its closed states by increasing the speed of gating. Found predominantly in cardiac and vascular smooth muscle and neurons. Gating of the atrial K+ channel is mechanosensitive, and mechanical pressure applied to a cardiac cell leads to an increase in their activity.

Tryptophan-specific regulation of enzyme activity level occurs through feedback regulation by the end product of the pathway, regulated by a tryptophan regulatory element (62LLESAKTNNELDRYS76) within Trp2. Component I (Trp2) and Component II (Trp3) are required for glutamine-dependent ASase activity while component I can use ammonia as cosubstrate without need of complex formation. .

RPD3S recognizes the SET2 methylated histones and deacetylates histones within transcribed sequences. This erases transcription elongation-associated histone acetylation and serves to repress the occurrence of spurious transcription initiation from cryptic start sites within open reading frames.

CPX-186	Inward rectifying potassium channel complex, Kir6.2-SUR1	Weak inwards rectifying plasma membrane channel complex that facilitated the influx of potassium ions in an ATP- and MgADP-dependent manner and results in membrane hyperpolarisation and shortened action potentials. Activated by binding of MgADP or MgATP to the nucleotide binding domains (NBD) of the ABCC8/SUR1 subunit as well as extracellular K+ binding to the KCNJ11/Kir6.2 subunit. If MgATP binds it must first get hydrolised by the ATP hydrolysis activity of the NBD which also generates PtdIns(4,5)P2 from phosphatidylinositol. Channel activation possibly driven by conformational changes resulting from MgADP binding to SUR subunits and reducing ATP affinity to Kir6.2. Inhibited by intracellular ATP or ADP, Mg2+ and polyamines that bind to the Kir6.2 subunits. ATP/ADP probably changes the conformation of Kir6.2 while Mg2+ and polyamines physically block the flow of K+ through the channel pore. As ATP is a weak inhibitor Kir6.2 channels can open spontaneously and are classified as constitutively active ion channels. In the absence of ATP (but presence of MgATP), cardiac and pancreatic channels exhibit spontaneous bursts of rapid openings and closings (fast kinetics), which are separated by long closed intervals (slow kinetics). Conversely, ATP destabilizes channel open state and stabilizes its closed states by increasing the speed of gating. Found predominantly in pancreatic beta-cells where glucose metabolism leads to an increase in intracellular ATP and a concomitant fall in MgADP causing closure of K+ channels, membrane depolarization and opening of voltage-gated calcium channels which ultimately triggers insulin release.

CPX-1860	Anaphase-promoting core complex	APC, a key regulator of cell cycle progression, is a conserved cullin-RING E3 ubiqutin ligase which facilitates multiubiqutination of cell cycle proteins, including cyclins, so marking them for proteasomal destruction. Generally believed that APC acts as a scaffold that brings E2 enzymes and substrates into close proximity. APC activity is required for metaphase-anaphase transition, mitotic exit, G1 phase and DNA replication. Targets securin for destruction, which is necessary for chromosome segregation. APC seems to have similar function in meiosis. Co-activators, CDC20 (Q12834) and FRZ1/CDH1 (Q9UM11), associate with APC core complex at specific stages of cell cycle, and are thought to be involved in substrate specificity. APC-CDC20 (CPX-6087) is active in presence of high cyclin-cdk activity in M phase but after metaphase when cyclin-cdk activity decreases, FRZ1 is dephosphorylated, CDC20 is degraded and APC-FRZ1 (CPX-6088) activated.

CPX-1867	Nuclear mitotic cohesin complex	Required for sister chromatid cohesion during cell division, which enables cells to attach sister kinetochores to microtubules with opposing polarity (bi-orientation) and subsequently resists the tendency of these microtubules to pull chromatids toward opposite spindle poles. Before the commencement of replication, the cohesin complex (CPX-1408) is loaded onto DNA. The arms of the Smc1/3 molecules embrace the DNA, thereby forming a ring of approx. 40 nm diameter. The head domains of Smc1 and Smc3 are locked together by Scc1. Cohesion might be generated as the replication fork passes through the ring, entrapping both sister chromatids inside. At the metaphase to anaphase transition, Scc1 is cleaved by separase, thereby opening the lock of the Smc1/3 head domains. The ring opens and sister chromatids can be pulled to opposite spindle poles.	Cohesin complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:559292

CPX-1893	MPP10 complex	Required for early co-transcriptional events in ribosome biogenesis, acting as an RNA chaperone to initiate ribosome assembly. IMP3 protein directly associates with the first 70 nucleotides of the U3 snoRNA, with a stem-loop structure within the hinge region, and thereby directs the preassembled MPP10 complex to the U3 preprocessome. A sub-unit of the small subunit (SSU) processome, a 2.2 MDa ribonucleoprotein complex involved in the processing, assembly and maturation of nascent pre-ribosomal RNA to form the small ribosomal subunit.

CPX-1898	CBF3 complex	Binds to the CDEIII DNA element, conserved between all yeast chromosomes, early in kinetochore assembly and acts as the the primary determinant of assembly. Binding of the CBF3 complex and presence of the unique N-terminal tails of the two CSE4 (P36012) molecules in the nucleosome could cooperate to induce a sharp bending of the centromeric DNA, thus creating a C-loop structure in which the CSE4 nucleosome is proximal to the plus end of the kinetochore. Alternatively, CSE4-nucleosomes are part of the highly phased array of nucleosomes on either side of the CEN-sequence, while CFB3 occupies CDEIII and additional Ndc10 molecules occupy the CDEII sites to form an extended binding platform. microtubule	CBF3A-CBF3B-CBF3C-SKP1 complex|centromere DNA-binding protein complex CBF3		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:559292

CPX-19	Telomerase catalytic core complex	A ribonucleoprotein complex essential for the replication of chromosome termini in most eukaryotes. Catalytic component of the teleromerase holoenzyme complex whose main activity is the elongation of telomeres. Acts as a reverse transcriptase that adds simple sequence repeats to chromosome ends by copying a template sequence within the RNA component of the enzyme. Catalyzes the RNA-dependent extension of 3'-chromosomal termini with the 6-nucleotide telomeric repeat unit, 5'-TTAGGG-3'. The catalytic cycle involves primer binding, primer extension and either release of product once the template boundary has been reached or nascent product translocation followed by further extension. Overexpressed telomerase results in telomere lengthening which may lead to cell immortalization and cancer cell pathogenesis.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:10090

CPX-1900	Chromosomal passenger complex	Serine/threonine kinase complex which ensures chromosome bi-orientation on the mitotic spindle during metaphase by phosphorylating multiple kinetochore components. It destabilizes monopolar attachments by phosphorylating key proteins at the kinetophore. The opposing Chromosomal Passenger complex and Glc7 (P32598) activities ensure that chromosomes achieve a bipolar attachment to the spindle. Monopolar attachments do not produce tension across sister kinetochores (and the complex may act by sensing this absence of tension). The Chromosome passenger complex is conserved from yeast to man and is an essential regulator of diverse aspects of mitosis that ensure faithful chromosome segregation. The complex undergoes changes in its localization throughout mitosis: in early mitosis it presumably localizes to chromosome arms while later in metaphase it is found at the centromere. At anaphase onset it re-localizes to mitotic spindle microtubules accumulating in the midbody in late anaphase where it promotes spindle disassembly and cytokinesis. In budding yeast it seems to follow the positive ends of depolimerizing microtubules in late anaphase. It also plays a role in contractile ring formation and regulation of abscission in cytokinesis.

CPX-1904	Peroxisomal PEX13-PEX14-PEX17 docking complex	Facilitates the peroxoisomal-membrane docking of cargo-loaded, peroxisomal targeting signal type 1 (PTS1) and PTS2 proteins. Proteins designated for peroxisomes are synthezised on cytosolic ribosomes and are recognised by the receptor PEX5 (P35056) via their PTS1 or the PEX7-PEX18 receptor complex via their PTS2 The receptor-cargo-complexes bind to the docking-complex at the peroxisomal membrane.

Can recruit different isoforms of IAPs, such as cFLIPs or cFLIPl. Can induce necroptosis or apoptosis, depending on the composition of heterodimers of CASP8 and cFLIP isoforms: predominance of CASP8-CASP8 homodimers induces apoptosis, predominance of CASP8-cFLIP heterodimers induces necroptosis.

CPX-1908	BBSome complex	The BBSome complex is thought to function as a coat complex required for sorting of specific membrane proteins to the primary cilia. The BBSome complex is required for ciliogenesis but is dispensable for centriolar satellite function. This ciliogenic function is mediated in part by the Rab8 GDP/GTP exchange factor (P61006/Q92930), which localizes to the basal body and contacts the BBSome. RAB8(GTP) enters the primary cilium and promotes extension of the ciliary membrane. Firstly the BBSome associates with the ciliary membrane and binds to RAB3IP/RABIN8, the guanosyl exchange factor (GEF) for RAB8 and then the RAB8-GTP localizes to the cilium and promotes docking and fusion of carrier vesicles to the base of the ciliary membrane.

CPX-1915	Nuclear origin recognition complex	Binds and encircles origins of replication. DNA-binding is ATP-dependent, however specific DNA sequences that define origins of replication have not yet been identified. ORC recruits CDC6 and CDT1 to promote the loading of the MCM2-7 mini-chromosome maintenance complex (CPX-2940) onto chromatin to form the pre-replication complex necessary to initiate DNA replication. ORC is dynamically assembled and disassembled during the cell cycle. The complex is formed in an ATP-dependent manner at the exit from anaphase of mitosis and the complex binds to chromatin in an ORC1-dependent manner. ORC is disassemnbled in S phase, either by degradation of ORC1 or by a process involving ATP hydrolysis in the complex.

When C1q binds to an activating target, a conformational change triggers the auto-activation of the associated C1R protease (converting the pro-enzyme into an activated form), which activates C1S. C1S then cleaves the Arg-|-Ala bond in complement component C4 to form C4a and C4b, and the Lys(or Arg)-|-Lys bond in complement component C2 to form C2a and C2b which in turn form C3 convertase complexes C4bC2a-A (CPX-5675) and C4bC2a-B.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606

CPX-1933	DnaB-DnaG primase-helicase complex	Involved in the synthesis of RNA primer sequences used in DNA replication. dnaG binding to dnaB displaces dnaC from dnaB (CPX-1934), activates the helicase and transposition activity of dnaB and thereby moves replication from the initiation to the priming phase. The interaction of the dnaB helicase and dnaG primase at the replication folk stimulates each others activities: As the helicase unwinds the parental DNA, the primase synthesises Okasaki RNA primers. Finally, DNA Polymerase III holoenzyme docks onto the primer-ssDNA duplex and initiates DNA synthesis.	core primosome|primosome		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:83333
CPX-1934	dnaB-dnaC complex	After the formation of a DNA bubble, two dnaB helicase hexamers are recruited and loaded onto each of the separated single-stranded DNA strands as dnaB-dnaC complexes. Binding of the helicase loader dnaC inhibits the ATPase and helicase activities of dnaB. dnaC needs to be displaced by the binding of primase dnaG to dnaB before dnaB can initiate its helicase function. Upon binding DNA, dnaC hydrolyzes ATP, allowing dnaB to isomerize into a topologically closed, pre-translocation state competent to bind primase			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:83333
CPX-1936	Divisome complex	Mediates the process of cell division, forming a tightly regulated peptidoglycan (PG) synthesis machine that builds a septum between the segregated chromosomes to separate the cell into two daughter cells. ftsZ forms a ring-like structure (Z-ring) at the midcell which establishes the division plane and enables the assembly of the divisome. Arrival of ftsN at the Z ring signals the completion of divisome core assembly and activates septal PG synthesis by activating the enzymatic activities of the two PG synthases, ftsW and ftsI. Additional proteins are known to transiently associate with this core complex but are not essential or conditionally essential for division.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:83333
CPX-1937	Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase complex	Plays a key role in both pyrimidine and arginine biosynthesis by catalyzing the production of carbamoyl phosphate from one molecule of bicarbonate, two molecules of MgATP, and one molecule of glutamine. Consists of two polypeptide chains referred to as the small and large subunits, which contain a total of three separate active sites that are connected by an intramolecular tunnel. The small subunit harbors one of these active sites and is responsible for the hydrolysis of glutamine to glutamate and ammonia. The large subunit binds the two required molecules of MgATP and is involved in assembling the final product. Compounds such as L-ornithine, UMP, and IMP allosterically regulate the enzyme.

CPX-1939	TRAPP II complex	Tethering complexes which provide the initial recognition event that links a particular vesicle with its target membrane. Participates in intra-Golgi and endosome-Golgi transport. Binds to a component of the COPI coat. BET3, BET5, TRS23, and TRS31 create a catalytic site for promoting GDP/GTP exchange in YPT1.

CPX-194	Inward rectifying potassium channel complex, Kir6.2-SUR1	Weak inwards rectifying plasma membrane channel complex that facilitated the influx of potassium ions in an ATP- and MgADP-dependent manner and results in membrane hyperpolarisation and shortened action potentials. Activated by binding of MgADP or MgATP to the nucleotide binding domains (NBD) of the ABCC8/SUR1 subunit as well as extracellular K+ binding to the KCNJ11/Kir6.2 subunit. If MgATP binds it must first get hydrolised by the ATP hydrolysis activity of the NBD which also generates PtdIns(4,5)P2 from phosphatidylinositol. Channel activation possibly driven by conformational changes resulting from MgADP binding to SUR subunits and reducing ATP affinity to Kir6.2. Inhibited by intracellular ATP or ADP, Mg2+ and polyamines that bind to the Kir6.2 subunits. ATP/ADP probably changes the conformation of Kir6.2 while Mg2+ and polyamines physically block the flow of K+ through the channel pore. As ATP is a weak inhibitor Kir6.2 channels can open spontaneously and are classified as constitutively active ion channels. In the absence of ATP (but presence of MgATP), cardiac and pancreatic channels exhibit spontaneous bursts of rapid openings and closings (fast kinetics), which are separated by long closed intervals (slow kinetics). Conversely, ATP destabilizes channel open state and stabilizes its closed states by increasing the speed of gating. Found predominantly in pancreatic beta-cells where glucose metabolism leads to an increase in intracellular ATP and a concomitant fall in MgADP causing closure of K+ channels, membrane depolarization and opening of voltage-gated calcium channels which ultimately triggers insulin release.

CPX-1941	Exon junction core complex, MAGOH variant	Plays a role in translation, surveillance and localization of the maturing mRNA molecules. Deposited by spliceosomes at a conserved position of a pre-messenger RNA strand located upstream of exon junctions formed during RNA splicing. The EJC remains stably bound at this position as the mature messenger ribonucleoprotein particle is exported to the cytoplasm, potentially promoting export through its close association with the TREX complex. Binds RNA primarily through EIF4A3, a sequence-independent DEAD box protein that grasps RNA stably only when associated with its partners, RBM8A/Y14 and MAGOH which inhibit the DEAD-box protein EIF4A3 ATPase activity, trapping the ATP-bound EJC core onto spliced mRNA in a stable conformation. The EJC core serves as a binding platform for additional factors which together then interface with numerous machineries controlling mRNA export, translation, and decay. Discriminates between premature and normal translation termination events by providing architectural information regarding the position of (former) introns. When translation terminates on an mRNA upstream of at least one EJC, UPF3 (Q9H1J1/Q9BZI7) and its cofactors UPF1 (Q9H1J1) and UPF2 (Q9HAU5) orchestrate a series of events that destabilize the message by a process known as nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Also enhances translation of newly synthesized mRNAs through interactions between POLDIP3 (Q9BY77) and activated S6-kinase.	EJC|exon-exon junction complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606
CPX-1942	Exon junction subcomplex MAGOH-Y14	Component of the exon-junction complex (EJC, CPX-1941) that is formed in the nucleus and exported to the cytoplasm as part of the mature messenger ribonucleoprotein particle. Binding of the EJC key regulator PYM1 (Q9BRP8) to MAGOH-Y14 in the cytoplasm triggers disassembly of the EJC. MAGOH-Y14 complex remains bound in the same position on the spliced mRNA and requires translation of the mRNA for removal. When interacting with PYM1, associates with mRNA-degradation factors, including the mRNA-decapping complex and exoribonucleases and may play a role in preventing mRNA degradation during mRNA biogenesis. This complex itself does not bind RNA. Binding to IPO13 (O94829) leads to import back into the nucleus prior to reassembly of the EJC.

CPX-1943	dnaA oligomeric complex	A dnaA homo-oligomer consisting of some 20 dnaA molecules binds specific DNA regions (dnaA boxes, R sites, I sites and tau sites) at the replication origin oriC. The dnaA box has a 9bp consensus structure 5'-TTATC[CA]A[CA]A-3'. ATP-dnaA binds to low affinity boxes and oligomerizes to form a helical filament on oriC. Aided by diaA (P66817) and HU (CPX-1958/CPX-1959) and catalysed through ATP hydrolysis, dnaA undergoes a major conformational change and unwinds double-stranded DNA at specific 13mer sites. DNA wrapping around the dnaA filament causes torsional strain in the AT-rich DNA unwinding element (DUE), contributing to DNA melting. The dnaA filament then extends beyond the dnaA boxes with the AAA+ domain interacting with DnaA-trio.This sequesters and stretches one strand of the DUE ,facilitating DNA melting and bubble formation before recruiting the dnaB-dnaC complex (CPX-1934) and associated proteins to initiate DNA replication.

CPX-1944	DnaA-L2 DNA replication initiation inhibitory complex	Contributes to the regulation of replication initiation preventing multiple replication origins during one replication cycle: L2 interacts with the N-terminal domain of DnaA destabilizing dnaA oligomers at the replication origin (oriC) and thus inhibits DNA-dependent duplex unwinding element unwinding.

CPX-1946	dnaB helicase complex	Homohexameric helicase which participates in initiation and elongation during DNA replication, using the energy of ATP hydrolysis to translocate down the lagging-strand template, splitting two strands apart in advance of the leading-strand replicase, Pol III (CPX-1925). Exhibits DNA-dependent ATPase activity and contains distinct active sites for ATP binding, DNA binding, and interaction with dnaA, dnaC, dnaG (primase), and other prepriming proteins. Two DnaB helicase hexamers are recruited and loaded onto each of the separated single-stranded (ss)DNA strands and unwind DNA bi-directionally away from the replication fork by translocating along and encircling the ssDNA.

CPX-1947	Methionyl glutamyl tRNA synthetase complex	Catalyzes the aminoacylation of tRNAs by their cognate amino acid. Arc1p makes contact with MetRS and GluRS through its amino-terminal domain, while its carboxy-terminal contains a tRNA-binding domain. As a result of the formation of this complex, cognate tRNAs are bound with high affinity and aminoacylation efficiency is increased.

CPX-1948	dnaA-dps DNA replication initiation inhibitory complex	Complex formation reduces replication initiation on oriC under oxidative stress conditions, preventing DNA opening by dnaA thus allowing DNA repair to proceed prior to new rounds of replication.

CPX-1949	Elongator holoenzyme complex	N-acetyltransferase which acts to form modified wobble uridines in tRNA, such as 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-uridine (mcm5U), 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2-thio-uridine (mcm5s2U), and 5-carbamoylmethyl-uridine (ncm5U). These sites influence the recognition rate and affinity between incoming tRNAs and codons in the A site of the translating ribosome, stablizing transient pausing events thus supporting proper domain folding of the nascent polypeptide chains during the elongation phase of the ribosome‐mediated translation process.

Inhibited by intracellular ATP or ADP, Mg2+ and polyamines that bind to the Kir6.2 subunits. ATP/ADP probably changes the conformation of Kir6.2 while Mg2+ and polyamines physically block the flow of K+ through the channel pore. Also inhibited by exogenous sulfonylureas by binding to intracellular loops (possibly by displacing MgADP from NBDs) and used to treat diabetic disorders. As ATP is a weak inhibitor Kir6.2 channels can open spontaneously and are classified as constitutively active ion channels. In the absence of ATP (but presence of MgATP), cardiac and pancreatic channels exhibit spontaneous bursts of rapid openings and closings (fast kinetics), which are separated by long closed intervals (slow kinetics).

CPX-1950	dnaA-dnaB-dnaC loader complex	The dnaB helicase is associated with a inhibitory/loader protein, dnaC, an AAA+ ATPase which, together with dnaA, chaperones two dnaB hexamers onto single-stranded DNA strands during initiation of replication. dnaA loads one dnaB-dnaC complex (CPX-1934) on the top strand near the left border of oriC and a second dnaB-dnaC complex on the lower strand next to dnaA box R1.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:83333
CPX-1951	Replication restart pre-primosome complex, priAB variant	Required for the restart of replication at sites of premature termination of DNA replication which leaves collapsed/abandoned replication forks that would otherwise create double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) on the next round of replication. Serves to reload the replicative helicase dnaB on sites far removed from the origin of replication in a DNA structure-dependent manner.The PriA-PriB variant appears to be the dominant restart mechanism in E.coli, with priA binding single-stranded, double-stranded and forked DNA with high affinity. PriB appears to be important for restart following DNA recombination. On binding, priA undergoes a conformational change, exposing the priB binding site. The priA:priB:DNA ternary interaction stabilizes priA on the DNA and enhances its helicase activity, facilitating unwinding of the nascent lagging strand if one is present. dnaT is recruited to the priA:priB:DNA ternary complex which leads to release of ssDNA by priB. The dnaB-dnaC complex (CPX-1934) is recruited to the primosome, possibly through direct contacts with dnaT and the dnaB is loaded from dnaB-dnaC onto ssDNA on the lagging strand template.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:83333
CPX-1952	Replication restart pre-primosome complex, priAC variant	Required for the restart of replication at sites of premature termination of DNA replication which leaves collapsed/abandoned replication forks that would otherwise create double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) on the next round of replication. Serves to reload the replicative helicase dnaB on sites far removed from the origin of replication in a DNA structure-dependent manner. priA binds single-stranded, double-stranded and forked DNA with high affinity. priC binds ssDNA, preferentially associating with replication forks that include at least 7 nucleotide gaps between the nascent leading strand and replication fork. The dnaB-dnaC complex (CPX-1934) is recruited to the primosome, possibly through direct contacts with dnaT and the dnaB is loaded from dnaB-dnaC onto ssDNA on the lagging strand template.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:83333
CPX-1953	Replication restart pre-primosome complex priC-rep variant	Required for the restart of replication at sites of premature termination of DNA replication which leaves collapsed/abandoned replication forks that would otherwise create double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) on the next round of replication. Serves to reload the replicative helicase dnaB on sites far removed from the origin of replication in a DNA structure-dependent manner. On replication forks lacking nascent leading and lagging strands priC is sufficient to load DnaB from the DnaB-DnaC complex in the absence of any other restart proteins but appears to require the rep helicase to create single-stranded DNA on the lagging strand for restart pathway progression or to remove nascent lagging strand DNA to enable priC-mediated loading of dnaB.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:83333

CPX-1955	SeqA-DNA complex	Believed to be involved in negative supercoiling of the DNA forming nucleoid compaction. SeqA forms filaments on methylated and hemimethylated DNA but has a higher avidity for hemimethylated GATC sites. Hemimethylated DNA is created during complementary strand synthesis before Dam protein fully methylates the new stand. Binding of SeqA to hemimethylated DNA sequesters the chromosomal replication origin, oriC, preventing re-methylation of DNA by Dam and in turn stopping premature re-initiation of replication during one replication cycle. Depletion of the SeqA pool towards the end of the replication cycle allows Dam protein to displace SeqA from the hemimethylated DNA, allowing it to fully methylate the DNA and initiate a new cycle of DNA replication. The SeqA-DNA complex travels with the replication folk sequentially binding to the majority of hemimethylated GATC sites of the newly-synthesized dsDNA. SeqA can form multimers consisting of dimers, tetramers octamers and higher order filaments but it is believed that the main form in vivo are filaments.

Conversely, ATP destabilizes channel open state and stabilizes its closed states by increasing the speed of gating.

CPX-197	Inward rectifying potassium channel complex, Kir6.2-SUR2A	Weak inwards rectifying plasma membrane channel complex that facilitated the influx of potassium ions in an ATP- and MgADP-dependent manner and results in membrane hyperpolarisation and shortened action potentials. Activated by binding of MgADP or MgATP to the nucleotide binding domains (NBD) of the ABCC9/SUR2A subunit as well as extracellular K+ binding to the KCNJ11/Kir6.2 subunit. If MgATP binds it must first get hydrolised by the ATP hydrolysis activity of the NBD which also generates PtdIns(4,5)P2 from phosphatidylinositol. Channel activation possibly driven by conformational changes resulting from MgADP binding to SUR subunits and reducing ATP affinity to Kir6.2. Inhibited by intracellular ATP or ADP, Mg2+ and polyamines that bind to the Kir6.2 subunits. ATP/ADP probably changes the conformation of Kir6.2 while Mg2+ and polyamines physically block the flow of K+ through the channel pore. Also inhibited by exogenous sulfonylureas by binding to intracellular loops (possibly by displacing MgADP from NBDs). As ATP is a weak inhibitor Kir6.2 channels can open spontaneously and are classified as constitutively active ion channels. In the absence of ATP (but presence of MgATP), cardiac channels exhibit spontaneous bursts of rapid openings and closings (fast kinetics), which are separated by long closed intervals (slow kinetics). Conversely, ATP destabilizes channel open state and stabilizes its closed states by increasing the speed of gating. Found predominantly in cardiac smooth muscle, skeletal muscle smooth muscle, neurons and ovaries. Gating of the atrial K+ channel is mechanosensitive, and mechanical pressure applied to a cardiac cell leads to an increase in their activity.

CPX-1974	Nitrate reductase A complex	Inducible nitrate reductase complex involved in electron transport during anaerobic respiration: electrons are passed from the formate dehydrogenase-N (Fdh-N) complex (CPX-1975) to the nitrate reductase complex via a quinone-quinol redox reaction. Within Nitrate redctase A, the distal heme molecule of NarI receives electrons from quinol (hydroquinone), passes them on to the proximal heme which passes it down a Fe-S cluster chain to the molybdopterin cofactor Mo-bisMGD where nitrate is reduced to nitrite. The collaboration of these two complexes contributes to the proton motive force: electrons are ultimately donated to Fdh-N by formate in the periplasm, transported to the cytoplasm and accepted by nitrate. Hydrogen ions are transported in the opposite direction: Quinone is reduced to quinol by cytoplasmic protons which are in turn released into the periplasm when quinol is oxidized to quinone. Expression of the thenarGHJI operon isinduced by nitrate.

CPX-2102	Cytochrome bo3 ubiquinol oxidase complex	A heme-copper oxidase integral to the bacterial electron transport chain. Electrons are donated by the oxidation of ubiquinol to ubiquinone, transferred to a slow-spinning heme b and subsequently accepted by a binuclear centre consisting of a heme o3 and a copper ion. In the process, the ubiquinol oxidase functions as a proton pump creating a transmembrane electrochemical gradient as 4 hydrogen ions are pumped through the membrane into the periplasmic space while 1/2 O2 molecule is oxidized to water. The electron transport happens exclusively in subunit I (cyoB). Ubiquinol oxidase is the final electron acceptor in the bacterial respiratory chain and thought to possess one of the most important functions in the cellular system due to its anti-oxidant properties.

CPX-2104	HslUV protease complex	A proteasome-like degradation complex with two functional subunits: the hslU hexamer forms the ATPase subunit which has chaperone activity and the hslV duodecamer forms the protease subunit. The binding of ATP and its subsequent hydrolysis by hslU are essential for unfolding of protein substrates subsequently hydrolyzed by hslV. hslU recognizes the N-terminal part of its protein substrates and unfolds these before they are guided to hslV for hydrolysis. ATP hydrolysis causes a conformational change in the hslU subunit 'closing' the central pore and 'un-docking' the ATPase unit from the protease by way of flicking the hslU C-terminus from the hslV-hslV interface into the hslU-hslU interface. The complex has been shown to be involved in the specific degradation of heat shock induced transcription factors such as rpoH and sulA. In addition, small hydrophobic peptides are also hydrolyzed by hslV. hslV has weak protease activity even in the absence of hslU, but this activity is induced more than 100-fold in the presence of hslU. Owing to the size of the central pore of both subunits hslUV is not believed to degrade folded proteins.

CPX-2159	GABA-A receptor, alpha1-beta2-gamma2	Ligand-gated chloride channel which acts as the main driver of fast inhibitory neurotransmission in the nervous system. GABA (CHEBI:16865), the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate brain, mediates neuronal inhibition by binding to the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor and opening a chloride ion-selective pore. GABA-A receptors assemble in specific combinations of receptor subunits from a pool of nineteen in a cell-type specific manner, giving rise to receptors with distinct distributions and functions in both physiological and disease states. Their many allosteric sites, which bind compounds with anticonvulsant, anti-anxiety, analgesic, sedative and anaesthetic properties make GABA-A receptors attractive drug targets. The alpha1-beta2-gamma2 conformation is thought to be the most common GABA-A receptor found in the brain. Also found in liver, smooth airways muscle and immune cells. Mediates the sedative, anterograde amnestic and in part anticonvulsant actions of diazepam. Isoform 1 and isoform 2 of GABRB2 show reduced expression in schizophrenic brain. Isoform 3 shows increased expression in schizophrenic and bipolar disorder brains while isoform 4 shows reduced expression.

CPX-216	Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor complex, alpha4-alpha5-beta2	A ligand-gated ion channel receptor complex that is sensitive to endogenous achetylcholine and exogenous nicotinic agents. Ligand binding causes a conformational change of the receptor resulting in the formation of a pore that is permeable to Na+ and/or Ca2+ (inward) and K+ (outward) thereby depolarising the neuron. Mediates fast, short-lived, predominantly post-synaptic (PMID:8461135) transmission of neurotransmitters. Mainly found in Central Nervous System.

It mediates ATP-dependent activation of SUMO proteins followed by formation of a thioester bond between a SUMO protein and a conserved active site cysteine residue on UBA2/SAE2. SUMOylation of UBA2 on three Lys residues on the bipartite nuclear localization sequence (NLS) and two Lys residues outside of but adjacent to the NLS catalyzed by Ubc9 is required for nuclear retention on the complex.

GABA-A receptor assemble in specific combinations of receptor subunits from a pool of nineteen in a cell-type specific manner, giving rise to receptors with distinct distributions and functions in both physiological and disease states. Predominantly expressed in the cerebral cortex, the GABA-A, alpha-5 receptor subtypes constitute less than 5% of the entire receptor population but up to 25% of the receptor subtype are located in the crucial learning and memory-associated area of the brain; the hippocampus. Largely absent at GABAergic synapses, exhibit little synaptic phasic inhibition, but abundant in the dendritic regions of extrasynaptic sites, and mediate tonic inhibition with continuously occurring smaller amplitude. Their many allosteric sites, which bind compounds with anticonvulsant, anti-anxiety, analgesic, sedative and anaesthetic properties make GABA-A receptors attractive drug targets: 1) Positive allosteric modulation of GABA-A alpha-5 receptor subtypes can selectively decrease hippocampal activity and reverse psychosis-like physiological and behavioural changes in rats; may potentially help treat patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and comorbid psychosis; allopregnanolone (CHEBI:50169), a naturally occurring progesterone derivative, is a PAM referred to as brexanolone when used for the medical treatment of moderate to severe postpartum depression. 2) Negative-allosteric modulators for reducing their tonic inhibition have been shown to enhance learning and memory in neurological disorders such as schizophrenia, Down syndrome, and autism with a possible alternative benzodiazepine binding site.

CPX-2171	Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor complex, alpha9-alpha10	A ligand-gated ion channel receptor complex that is sensitive to endogenous achetylcholine and exogenous antagonists such as alpha-bungarotoxin. Unlike classic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, nicotine blocks acetylcholine-evoked currents in alpha9-alpha10 receptors giving these receptors a pharmacological profile unknown for any other nicotinic or muscarinic cholinergic receptor subtype. Ligand binding causes a conformational change of the receptor resulting in the formation of a pore that is permeable to Na+ and/or Ca2+ (inward) and K+ (outward) thereby depolarising the neuron. Upregulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines, for example TNF-alpha. Mediates fast, short-lived synaptic transmission of neurotransmitters and is more active than the alpha9 homopentamer (CPX-226). Mainly found in peripheral nervous system and non-neuronal cells, especially in the auditory system (mechanosensory hair, inner-ear tissue, the cochlea) but also in tonsils, immortalized B-cells, cultured T-cells and PBMCs, keratinocytes and in the pituitary gland. In the auditory system the subunits assemble to form the receptor that mediates synaptic transmission between efferent olivocochlear cholinergic fibers which descend from the brainstem and hair cells of the cochlea.	ionotropic acetylcholine receptor complex|neuronal acetylcholine receptor; alpha9-alpha10|neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine-gated cation channel complex|neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine-gated ion channel complex|neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine-gated receptor complex|neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine-gated receptor-channel complex|neuronal nicotinic cholinergic receptor complex, alpha9-alpha10		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606
CPX-2173	Amylin receptor 1 complex	A transmembrane, G-protein-coupled signalling receptor complex that serves as receptor for amylin polypeptide (Amy). Amylin is produced in beta-islet cells of the pancreas. It is implicated in selective inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose utilization and glycogen deposition in muscle, gastric emptying, gastric acid secretion, postprandial glucagon secretion and food intake and aids weight loss. CALCR only acts as amylin receptor when bound by RAMP proteins. In the absence of RAMP proteins, CALCR functions as calcitonin receptor. Contrary to the calcitonin receptor-like receptors (CPX-2189, CPX-2191, CPX-3148), the calcitonin receptor can migrate to the plasma membrane without guidance from RAMP proteins.

CPX-2175	5-hydroxytryptamine-3A receptor complex	Inward-rectifying, ligand-gated ion channel, which when activated by 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) causes fast neuronal depolarization and excitation or modulation of neurotransmitter release depending on their neuronal localisation (central and/or peripheral nervous system). A cation-specific, but otherwise relatively non-selective, ion channel with low conductance. Ca2+-permeability is related to subunit composition with 5HT3A homopentamers being more permeable than 5HT3A/B heteropentamers. Found pre- and post-synaptically but with different properties - pre-synaptic 5-HT3 receptors are predominantly calcium-permeant while post-synaptic receptors are permeant to Na+ and K+. Also Mg2+ permeant. Pre-synaptic depolarisations are generally slower than post-synaptic depolarisations. 5-HT3 receptors increase the frequency of spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic currents (sEPSCs) or miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs). These may be related to 5-HT3-induced depolarisation of pre-synaptic membranes and subsequent activation of cholinergic or glutamatergic neurotransmissions or evoked excitatory post-synaptic currents (eEPSCs) or spontaneous inhibitory post-synaptic currents (sIPSCs) related to GABAergic neurotransmissions post-synaptic 5-HT3 receptor activation. Due to different residues in transmembrane domain M2 of the 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B subunits the 5-HT3A/B heteromeric receptors are more efficient conductors than 5-HT3A homomeric receptors and have increased agonist and antagonist affinity. Homomeric receptors recover faster from desensitisation but are probably less prevalent in vivo. High levels of expression are found in the vagal terminals of the dorsal vagal complex where it is involved in the vomiting reflex (especially post-operative and chemotherapy- and radiation-induced vomiting and nausea), in the amygdala and the hippocampi. 5-HT3 receptor antagonists therefore act as effective anti-emetic drugs. Lower levels of expression are found in the forebrain with higher relative expression in the striatum than the cortical regions. Involved in processes associated with emotion, cognition, memory and pain perception. Involved in ganglionic transmission in the myenteric plexus in the mucosal layer and expressed in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract where serotonin mediates control over a variety of physiological functions such as the contraction/relaxation of smooth muscle, and peristaltic and secretory reflexes, directly or indirectly through intrinsic primary afferent neurons. Plays an important role in the regulation of inflammation and immune responses in the peripheral nervous system. Activation of 5-HT3 receptors on visceral afferents in some irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients results in visceral hypersensitivity. Chaperone proteins assist assembly, modifications and export from the ER followed by transport in vesicle-like structures along microtubules to the plasma membrane where they typically form clusters in F-actin-rich regions.	5-HT-3A receptor complex|5-HT-3A-R complex|5-HT-3AR complex|5-HT3-A receptor complex|5-HT3A receptor complex|5-HT3A-R complex|5-HT3AR complex|5-hydroxytryptamine 3A receptor complex|5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3A complex|5-hydroxytryptamine-3A cation channel receptor complex|5-hydroxytryptamine-3A cation-selective channel receptor complex|5-hydroxytryptamine-3A ion channel receptor complex|5-hydroxytryptamine-gated receptor 3A complex|5-hydroxytryptamine-gated receptor channel|5HT-3A receptor complex|5HT3-A receptor complex|5HT3A receptor complex|5HT3A-R complex|5HT3AR complex|HT-R3-A complex|HT-R3A complex|HTR3-A complex|HTR3A complex|Serotonin 3 (5-HT3) receptor|Serotonin 3A receptor complex|Serotonin receptor 3A complex|Serotonin-3A receptor complex|Serotonin-activated receptor 3A complex|Serotonin-gated receptor 3A complex|Serotonin-gated receptor channel		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606

CPX-2177	GyrA-GyrB DNA Gyrase complex	A DNA gyrase of type IIA topoisomerase that negatively supercoils closed circular double-stranded DNA in an ATP-dependent manner and also catalyzes the interconversion of other topological isomers of double-stranded DNA rings, including catenanes and knotted rings. It alters DNA topology by effecting a transient double-strand break in the DNA backbone, cleaving both strands and passing the double helix through 3 pairs of N-gates formed by ATPase domains of the gyrB subunit and resealing the gaps. It facilitates DNA melting at oriC in order for replication initiation to take place. DNA Gyrase also removes the left-handed positive supercoiling generated in front of moving replication forks. Structure-guided deletion of a 170-amino acid insertion (Thr565 - Arg731) in gyrB greatly reduces the DNA binding, supercoiling and DNA-stimulated ATPase activities of gyrase.

CPX-2188	Amiloride-sensitive sodium channel complex, alpha-beta-gamma	Inward cation channel with high sodium selectivity but also permeable to lithium. Activated under low extracellular sodium concentrations and self-inhibited by high extracellular sodium concentrations. Activation is dependent on proteolytic cleavage of alpha and gamma subunits, post-translational modifications (such as glycosylation of beta subunit and palmitoylation) and possibly cyclic nucleotides that lift self-inhibition. Regulated by hormones such as aldosterone and vasopressin and inhibited by the diuretic amiloride. Although the channel activity itself is not voltage-gated, ameloride-sensitivity may be voltage-dependent. Channel gating and conductance are comparatively slow. Plays an essential role in electrolyte and blood pressure homeostasis, but also in airway surface liquid (ASL) homeostasis, which is important for proper clearance of mucus and pathogens. Mutations leading to a loss of ASL homeostatis are a trigger for cystic fibrosis. The inward sodium transport may trigger action potentials in neurons by gradually depolarizing membrane potentials. In nephrons may also be activated by shear stress potentially changing the conformation of the bulky extracellular loop or the transmembrane domains and thereby increasing channel opening times. May also play a role in salt and sour taste perception. Found in the apical membrane of many epithelial cell types, especially in the Aldosterone Sensitive Distal Nephron (ASDN), kidney, colon, lung and sweat glands but also in heart, liver, pancreas, skeletal muscle and blood leukocytes. Also expressed in vascular endothelia where their mechanical properties and function differ from epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs) in other tissues: vascular endothelia are ‘leaky’, allowing passive sodium transport through the membrane. Here, ENaCs are activated by increased external sodium concentrations that enhances the sodium influx into the cell. May stabilize F-actin through strengthening of the inter-subunits causing swelling or stiffening of endothelia and which can ultimately lead to hypertension.

This process is ATP-hydrolysis-dependent which is provided by the ATPase activity of recD. The two helicases act with opposite polarity: recB is an SF1A enzyme with a 3'-5' polarity and recD an SF1B enzyme with a 5'-3' polarity. They cooperate to unwind DNA in a highly processive manner where the DNA gets unwound in the recB-recC interface with the 5' single-stranded (ss)DNA single-strand fed into the recD subunit and the 3'ssDNA remaining in the recB-recC dimer.

Unlike most CDKs, CDK5 is directly activated by the specific activators CDK5R1 (Q15078) and CDK5R2 (Q13319). Although cyclin I (Q14094) appears to be involved in the activation of CDK5 in the anti-apoptotic pathway (PMID:19729834) direct binding assays have yet to be published.

Activated by simultaneous binding of glycine to GluN1 and L-glutamate to GluN2. Blocked by physiological concentrations of extracellular magnesium which is released by membrane depolarization. Predominantly post-synaptic receptor that mediates mostly the late/slow phase of the majority of the fast excitatory neurotransmission in the mammalian brain where it plays a key role in synaptic plasticity, synaptogenesis, excitotoxicity, memory acquisition and learning. Combinations of different receptor isoforms and their splice variants result in formation of ion channels with distinct spatiotemporal expression patterns and pharmacological and electrophysiological properties. Replacement of one or more subunits with GluN3A (Q8TCU5) or GluN3B (O60391) subunits results in relatively Ca2+-impermeable cation channels that are resistant to Mg2+. Dysfunctional NMDA receptors are implicated in various neurological disorders and injuries including depression, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, chronic and neuropathic pain, as well as neuronal loss following ischaemia or stroke.

CPX-2225	Myosin class V complex, MYO2 variant	Building block of the class V myosin processive molecular motor involved in a range of organelle-transporting functions, including the transport of vacuoles and mRNA. The myosin heavy chain motor domain mediates the ATP-dependent interaction with the F-actin cytoskeleton. The myosin neck region with the bound light chains acts as a rigid lever arm that amplifies movements within the myosin motor domain into a large mechanical stroke that directionally propels the myosin along the actin filament. Myosin V has a high duty cycle, i.e. remains attached to actin for a large fraction of the mechanochemical cycle due to the slow rate of ADP release, the rate-limiting step in the ATPase cycle. This kinetic adaptation allows myosin V to take multiple steps without dissociating from the actin filament. Myosin V can take large steps of approximately 36nm, a distance equal to the helical repeat of the actin filament allowing Myosin V to walk in a straight line on the actin filament, in a hand-over-hand fashion.

CPX-2227	SF3B complex	Role in pre-mRNA splicing. The SF3B complex is recruited to the 12S U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP), generating the 15S U2 snRNP. The SF3A complex (CPX-2565) is then incorporated into the snRNP, forming the functional 17S U2 snRNP. As the17S snRNP enters the spliceosome, SF3b6 recognizes the branch site adenosine in pre-mRNA and facilitates an interaction between U2 and the branch point sequence. Once catalytic activation of the spliceosome is primed, the SF3B complex is removed from the branch point through the action of the ATPase DHX16 (O60231) but still binds loosely to U2 within the spliceosome until it finally disassembles from the splicing machinery.

CPX-223	Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor complex, alpha9-alpha10	A ligand-gated ion channel receptor complex that is sensitive to endogenous achetylcholine and exogenous antagonists such as alpha-bungarotoxin. Unlike classic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, nicotine blocks acetylcholine-evoked currents in alpha9-alpha10 receptors giving these receptors a pharmacological profile unknown for any other nicotinic or muscarinic cholinergic receptor subtype. Ligand binding causes a conformational change of the receptor resulting in the formation of a pore that is permeable to Na+ and/or Ca2+ (inward) and K+ (outward) thereby depolarising the neuron. Upregulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines, for example TNF-alpha. Mediates fast, short-lived synaptic transmission of neurotransmitters and is more active than the alpha9 homopentamer (CPX-227). Mainly found in peripheral nervous system and non-neuronal cells, especially in the auditory system (mechanosensory hair, inner-ear tissue, the cochlea) but also in tonsils, immortalized B-cells, cultured T-cells and PBMCs, keratinocytes and in the pituitary gland.

SCF-FBXL5 target proteins include the iron regulatory protein IRP2 (P48200). The stability of FBXL5 increases under iron- and oxygen-replete conditions and decreases with iron depletion. This differential stability is mediated by an iron- and oxygen-binding hemerythrin domain (IPR012312) that acts as a ligand-dependent regulatory potentially linking iron sensing via the FBXL5 hemerythrin domain, IRP2 regulation, and cellular responses to maintain mammalian iron homeostasis.

In the absence of glucose, ptsG mainly exists in a phosphorylated form and does not bind mlc. When glucose is available, transported glucose takes the glucose-specific enzyme II complex (CPX-5943) forms and transfer the phosphate residue onto its glucose ligand. Dephosphorylated membrane-bound ptsG binds mlc and sequesters it from its target promoters. This leads to increased synthesis of ptsG and other phosphotransferase system proteins required for glucose import and metabolism.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:83333

CPX-228	Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor complex, alpha9	A ligand-gated ion channel receptor complex that is sensitive to endogenous achetylcholine and exogenous antagonists like alpha-bungarotoxin. Contrary to classic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors nicotine blocks acetylcholine-evoked currents in alpha9 receptors giving these receptors a pharmacological profile unknown for any other nicotinic or muscarinic cholinergic receptor subtype. Ligand binding causes a conformational change of the receptor resulting in the formation of a pore that is permeable to Na+ and/or Ca2+ (inward) and K+ (outward) thereby depolarising the neuron. Upregulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines, like TNF-alpha. Mediates fast, short-lived synaptic transmission of neurotransmitters and is less active than the alpha9-alpha10 heteropentamer (CPX-224). Mainly found in peripheral nervous system and non-neuronal cells, esp. in the auditory system (mechanosensory hair, inner-ear tissue, the cochlea) but also in tonsils, immortalized B-cells, cultured T-cells and PBMCs, keratinocytes and in the pituitary gland. In the auditory system assembles, possibly with the alpha10 subunit, to form the receptor that mediates synaptic transmission between efferent olivocochlear cholinergic fibers which descend from the brainstem and hair cells of the cochlea.	ionotropic acetylcholine receptor complex|neuronal acetylcholine receptor; alpha9|neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine-gated cation channel complex|neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine-gated ion channel complex|neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine-gated receptor complex|neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine-gated receptor-channel complex|neuronal nicotinic cholinergic receptor complex, alpha9		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:10116

CPX-2300	CRL3 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, SPOP variant	E3 ubiquitin ligase which catalyzes the transfer of ubiquitin from an E2 enzyme to a substrate bound to a substrate receptor by promoting the formation of an isopeptide bond between the Ub carboxy-terminus and specific lysine side chains on the substrate. SPOP is required to maintain normal cellular growth and development and its targets include the polycomb protein BMI1 (P35226), the apoptosis factor DAXX (Q9UER7), the pancreatic and duodenal homeobox protein PDX1 (P52945), and the Hedgehog signaling transcription factors GLI2 (P10070) and GLI3 (P10071). SPOP forms linear higher-order oligomers which enables it to present multiple MATH domains (IPR002083) for binding to multiple low-affinity motifs in a single substrate, resulting in an overall increased affinity through avidity effects. SPOP oligomerization is also involved in phase separation.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606

CPX-2304	Heat-labile enterotoxin IIB complex	Member of the AB class of bacterial toxins. Binds to the ganglioside receptors on epithelial host cells and forms a pore in the host cell membrane, leading to the endocytosis of the A subunit. The A1 chain then ADP-ribosylates the alpha-subunit of the host heterotrimeric G-protein Gs, inducing constitutive activation of the cell’s adenylate cyclase and dramatically increasing the intracellular concentration of the host cAMP (CHEBI:17489) cellular signaling molecule. This originally evolved as a strategy to capture energy from host biological systems but leads to degradation of the host intestinal epithelium, resulting in severe diarrhoea in humans, pigs and bovine species.

CPX-2305	Non-canonical polycomb repressive complex 1.6, RING1-RYBP variant	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that acts as a transcriptional repressor by mediating the monoubiquitination of Lys-119 of histone H2A, compacting chromatin, stalling RNA polymerase II and transcriptionally silencing genes critical for development.

CPX-2308	Core mediator complex	Plays an essential role in gene expression regulation by acting as a bridge between DNA-binding transcription factors and the RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription machinery, serving as a central scaffold within the pre-initiation complex. The Mediator complex is also targeted by sequence-specific, DNA-binding transcription factors and appears to regulate RNAPII at both the initiation and elongation stages of transcription. The Mediator complex, having a compact conformation in its free form, is recruited to promoters by direct interactions with regulatory proteins and unfolds to an extended conformation and partially surrounds RNAPII specifically interacting with the unphosphorylated form of its C-terminal domain. The Mediator complex dissociates from the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme and stays at the promoter when transcriptional elongation begins. Reversibly associates with the CKM complex (CPX-7701). Mediator lacking the CKM complex has a stimulatory effect on basal transcription. In contrast, Mediator containing the sub-complex represses basal transcription.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:7227

CPX-231	Snf1 protein kinase complex variant GAL83	Energy sensor protein kinase complex, activated by glucose depletion. Regulates cellular energy metabolism by activating energy-producing pathways and inhibiting energy-consuming processes via derepression of glucose-repressed genes. Required for the diauxic shift, in which genes required for mitochondrial oxidative metabolism (normally repressed by glucose) are switched on; growth then resumes at a lower rate. Role in filamentous invasive growth, on glucose depletion, in haploid cells. Regulates haploid invasive growth in response to glucose depletion by affecting adherence by antagonizing NRG1- and NRG2-mediated repression of the FLO11 flocculin and adhesin gene. The activity of this complex is modulated by reversible phosphorylation of SNF1 Thr-210 which increases in response to glucose starvation and correlates with large increases in cellular ADP-to-ATP and AMP-to-ATP ratios. Binding of ADP, but not AMP, to the complex protects against dephosphorylation of Thr-210, suggesting that ADP, rather than AMP, may be the critical activating signal. When glucose levels are high, the complex is cytoplasmic. Upon glucose depletion, Gal83-containing SNF1 locates to the nucleus.

CPX-2387	DNA-directed RNA polymerase II complex, Pol II(G) variant	Catalyzes the transcription of RNA from a DNA template by acting as a nucleotidyl transferase that polymerizes ribonucleotides at the 3' end of an RNA transcript. Synthesizes precursors of mRNAs, and most snRNA and microRNAs. In the absence of Mediator, Pol II(G), unlike Pol II, inhibits transcription. During a transcription cycle, Pol II, general transcription factors and the mediator complex (CPX-3227) assemble as the preinitiation complex (PIC) at the promoter. 11-15 base pairs of DNA surrounding the transcription start site are melted and the single-stranded DNA template strand of the promoter is positioned deeply within the central active site cleft of Pol II to form the open complex. After synthesis of about 30 bases of RNA, Pol II releases its contacts with the core promoter and the rest of the transcription machinery (promoter clearance) and enters the stage of transcription elongation in which it moves on the template as the transcript elongates. Pol II appears to oscillate between inactive and active conformations at each step of nucleotide addition. The formation of PolII(G) by the binding of POLR2M represses RNA polymerase II function by preventing TFIIF (CPX-79) and TFIIB (CPX-2398) from binding to Pol II, which contributes to the maintenance of Pol II an inactive state in the absence of Mediator. POLR2M and TFIIF associate with Pol II in a mutually exclusive manner, thus the formation of Pol II(G) prevents TFIIF from binding and leads to inhibition of PIC assembly.

CPX-2391	U4/U6.U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex	Major pre-formed spliceosome building block. The spliceosome executes pre-mRNA splicing through a highly dynamic series of compositional and conformational transitions encompassing assembly, activation, catalysis and disassembly of a highly dynamic structure, involving the binding and release of the small nuclear RNAs (snRNA) and protein factors which remove intronic sequence from pre-mRNA. Spliceosome stages are characterized as E, A, B and remodelling of the pre-catalytic spliceosome (B complex) into the activated spliceosome (Bact complex) and subsequently, the catalytically activated spliceosome (B* complex) to carry out two RNA-catalysed transesterification reactions that lead to intron removal and splicing together of the flanking exon sequences. Association of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP with the pre-spliceosomes E and A (i.e CPX-2392, CPX-2539 snRNPs bound to the 5' splice site and the branch site of the pre-mRNA intron respectively) leads to the formation of the mature spliceosomes, B and C. The DEAD-box helicase DDX23 releases the 5' splice site from U1 snRNP and transfers it to the ACAGAGA box within U6 snRNA. The RNA helicase SNRNP200 then separates U4 snRNA from U6 snRNA and allows the U6 snRNA sequence adjacent to the 5' splice site-bound ACAGAGA box to fold and associate with part of U2 snRNA to yield the active site harboring two catalytic metal ions. When the branch site adenosine is docked into the active site, the branching reaction produces the cleaved 5' exon and the lariat-intron intermediate. The 5' exon remains in the active site, but the branch site adenosine must leave the active site for the incoming 3′ splice site site for the exon–ligation reaction. Finally, the 5' and 3' exons are ligated, and the resulting mRNA is released from the active site.	U4/U6 x U5 tri-snRNP complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606
CPX-2392	U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex 	Recognizes the 5' splice site within precursor messenger RNAs and initiates the assembly of the spliceosome.

CPX-2393	DNA-directed RNA polymerase III complex, POLR3G variant	Catalyzes the transcription of RNA from an DNA template by acting as a nucleotidyl transferase that polymerizes ribonucleotides at the 3' end of an RNA transcript. Responsible for the transcription of genes encoding short non-coding RNAs, such as tRNA, 5S rRNA and U6 snRNA transcripts. Pol III machinery recognizes conserved promoter elements located within the transcribed region, generally the box A and box B sequences, which contribute to the D- and T-loops in the tRNA structure. POLR3F, POLR3G and POLR3C play a role in transcription initiation whereas the POLR3D-POLR3E heterodimer is crucial for the correct recognition of the termination signals of class III genes. POLR3K is required for RNA cleavage. Pol III initiation does not require ATP hydrolysis to open a transcription bubble to isolate and secure the template strand in the catalytic site and Pol III is capable of reinitiating transcription more rapidly on the same gene after the first transcription cycle without being released (facilitated reinitiation), resulting in a higher initiation efficiency; this appears to require an POLR3K-dependent conformational change of Pol III.

U6 is part of the activated spliceosome and is involved in the first transestherification step of splicing. After splicing is complete, the spliceosome disassembles and free U6 snRNP forms.

GABA-A receptors assemble in specific combinations of receptor subunits from a pool of nineteen in a cell-type specific manner, giving rise to receptors with distinct distributions and functions in both physiological and disease states. Their many allosteric sites, which bind compounds with anticonvulsant, anti-anxiety, analgesic, sedative and anaesthetic properties make GABA-A receptors attractive drug targets. The alpha1-beta2-gamma2 conformation is thought to be the most common GABA-A receptor found in the brain. Also found in liver, smooth airways muscle and immune cells. Mediates the sedative, anterograde amnestic and in part anticonvulsant actions of diazepam. Isoform 1 and isoform 2 of GABRB2 show reduced expression in schizophrenic brain.

CPX-2539	U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex	Non-coding RNA containing complex that is involved in mRNA splicing. U2 snRNP binds to the intron branch site of the commitment complex to form the pre-spliceosome in an ATP dependent step. Stably interacts with the pre-RNA intron branch site (BS), forming the spliceosomal A complex in which U2 snRNA base pairs with the BS, causing the branch site adenosine to bulge out from the U2/BS helix. The U2-BS interaction is reinforced by the U2AF65/35 heterodimer (CPX-1921), which binds the intron pyrimidine-rich region, and by the U2-associated, heteromeric protein complexes SF3A (CPX-2565) and SF3B (CPX-2227) that contact the intron 6 to 26 nucleotides upstream of the BS-A (anchoring site) Prior to the first catalytic reaction, SF3A and SF3B dissociate from the spliceosome, presumably making the branch site accessible to lariat formation. The spliceosome is a highly dynamic structure, assembled by sequential binding and release of the small nuclear RNAs and protein factors which removes intronic sequence from pre-mRNA. During formation of the activated spliceosome, U2 will replace the dissociating U4 to form base pairs with U6.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606

Functions in concert with RING E3 ubiquitin ligase RAD5 to catalyze the Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination of monoubiquitinated replication processivity factor PCNA (CPX-544). MMS2 positions the acceptor ubiquitin so that only Lys-63 approaches the active site cysteine of UBC13. This modification activates the recombination-like DNA damage-avoidance mechanism, in which the replicating polymerase avoids synthesis opposite damaged DNA by transient switching of the template, from the damaged DNA strand to the intact newly synthesized strand of the sister chromatid.

CPX-2545	LY96-TLR4 toll-like receptor complex	Type I membrane receptor that plays a crucial role in innate immunity by recognizing conserved patterns in diverse microbial molecules including lipoproteins, lipopeptides, lipopolysaccharide, flagellin, and nucleic acids. In the early step of bacterial infection, serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS, CHEBI:16412) binds to the N-terminal of LBP (P18428), LPS is then presented to CD14 (P08571) and transferred to LY96 or the LY96-TLR4 toll-like receptor complex. This induces the dimerization of TLR4 TIR domains, initiating CD14-dependent TLR4 endocytosis, and TICAM1/TRIF(Q8IUC6)-dependent signal transduction to promote inflammation caused by LPS.

CPX-25723	sTNF-TNR1A receptor-ligand core complex, BIRC3 variant	A membrane-bound tumor necrosis factor-receptor signaling complex (Complex I) formed on the binding of the soluble form of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, tumour necrosis factor (sTNF, CPX-8826). This activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF-kappa-B) signalling pathways, leading to proinflammatory gene expression and promoting cell survival. The Ripoptosome (CPX-1907, Complex II) originates from the dissociation of Complex I components from the receptor and promotes cell apoptosis. TNF, a key regulator of T regulatory cells, is mainly secreted by macrophages, T helper 1 and natural killer cells, while its receptor component TNFRSF1A is ubiquitously expressed on almost all human tissues. Intracellular signaling is triggered by ligand-bound receptors assembling into higher-order clusters. Soluble TNFA triggers more robust clustering of TNFR1 than membrane-bound ligand. TNFR1-mediated signaling is therefore generally caused by the activation due to sTNFA over mTNFA. TNFA-TNFRSF1A signalling complex formation is indirectly influenced by TNFA-TNFRSF1B activation and the cross-talk between the receptor complexes is central to cell-survival, proliferation or death.

TNFRSF1B is similar in its extracellular structure to TNFRSF1A (P19438) at the mTNF and sTNF binding sites, but it lacks the death domain found in TNFRSF1A. Instead, TNFRSF1B containss a TNF receptor associated factor (TRAF) binding site. mNF-stimulated TNFRSF1B complexes recruit TRAF2-BIRC2/3, reducing their availability for triggering MAP3K14/NIK (Q99558) degradation. As a result, NIK accumulates and drives NF-kappa-B signaling. Aggregation of the TNF-TNFR2 complexes brings two or more TRAF2-BIRC2/3 complexes into proximity, enabling BIRC2/3 transactivation of their E3 ligase activity resulting in Lys-63-ubiquitination of TRAF2. This generates docking sites for classical NF-kappa-B signaling-stimulating kinases. TNFA is a key regulator of T regulatory cells, mainly secreted by macrophages, T helper 1 and natural killer cells, and while TNFRSF1A is ubiquitously expressed, TNFRSF1B is mainly expressed by immune cells, neurons and endothelial cells.

CPX-25764	Mitochondrial proton translocating ATP synthase complex	Acts to convert the energy of oxidation-reduction reactions of the electron transport chain (respiration) to the phosphorylation of ADP. The synthesis of ATP is coupled to the respiratory chain via the proton potential. The ATP synthase is a molecular motor composed of two separable parts: F1 and F0.

F0 forms a proton turbine that is embedded in the inner membrane and connected to the rotor of F1. The flux of protons flowing down a potential gradient powers the rotation of the rotor driving the synthesis of ATP.

CPX-2595	Nuclear exosome	3' to 5' exo- and endoribonuclease complex that is involved in RNA maturation and degradation which include the removal of unstable and aberrant transcripts and may also regulate the levels of specific transcripts in response to environmental factors. Restricted to processing linear and circular single-stranded RNAs only. RNAs with complex secondary structures, particularly at the 3' end of the molecule, may have to be unwound or pre-processed by cofactors prior to entering the complex. Although some RNAs may be targeted directly to the catalytic subunits, the majority of substrates enter the barrel-like structure of the exosome through a pore at the centre of the cap and are threaded through the central channel in a 3' to 5' orientation. The ribonuclease activity of the catalytic subunits facilitates the degradation process. Two different exosomes exist in yeast, one found in the nucleus and nucleolus (this complex), the other form is lacking the RRP6 subunit and is found in the cytosol (CPX-603). The nuclear/nucleolar RNA exosome is involved in a) proper maturation of most RNA species such as intron-removal from pre-mRNAs and tRNA precursors and rRNA, snRNA, snoRNA, lncRNA and enhancer RNA processing, especially the removal of their 3-prime ends, b) the elimination of RNA processing by-products and non-coding, cryptic transcripts, such as upstream antisense RNA species (uaRNA), enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), heterochromatin-forming repetitive elements (ribosomal DNA repeats and centromeres) and long non-coding RNAs, c) the elimination of mRNAs with processing defects and mRNAs that fail to undergo proper splicing or 3′ end formation and d) gene expression either by mRNA processing or coordination of intron retention leading to regulation of decay of otherwise intact mRNAs. Nuclear exosome activity therefore limits or excludes export of target RNAs to the cytoplasm.

Exhibits weak selectivity for potassium over sodium ions and contributes to the native pacemaker currents in heart (If) and in neurons (Ih). Contrary to other ion-gated channels, HCN channels do not require an accessory unit but depolarisation activity is affected by optional accessory proteins such as TRIP8b (Pex5l, Q8C437) or lipids such as phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate.

CPX-26030	DNA replication factor C complex, ATAD5 variant	DNA-dependent ATPase clamp-unloader complex that acts to remove PCNA (P12004, CPX-538) remaining on DNA after the completion of DNA replication and repair during the S phase of the cell cycle. The complex binds to DNA-loaded PCNA to induce opening of the PCNA ring, leading to the release of ATAD5-RFC bound-PCNA. ATAD5-RFC is thought to unload PCNA many-fold more efficiently than the canonical RFC complex (CPX-415). PCNA release from the chromatin after chromosomal duplication is crucial in preventing inappropriate recruitment of replication enzymes and preventing premature termination of DNA replication. Additionally, ATAD5-RFC also participates in de-ubiquiniation of ubiquinated PCNA (Ub-PCNA) to aid in the removal of chromatin-bound Ub-PCNA from DNA to resume normal DNA replication after bypass.

Contrary to other HCN channels, HCN1 CNBD tetramerises at basal cAMP concentrations and therefore only exhibits a moderate response to cAMP binding. Located presynaptically. Exhibits weak selectivity for potassium over sodium ions and contributes to the native pacemaker currents in heart (If) and in neurons (Ih). Contrary to other ion-gated channels, HCN channels do not require an accessory unit but depolarisation activity is affected by optional accessory proteins such as TRIP8b (PEX5L, Q8IYB4) or lipids such as phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate.

Membrane sequestration of the FLCN-FNIP complex by GABARAP family members uncouples its regulation of RRAGC/RRAGD resulting in impaired substrate-specific mTOR-dependent phosphorylation of transcription factor TFE3 (P19532) and TFEB (P19484) which act as master regulators of lysosomal biogenesis, autophagy, lysosomal exocytosis, lipid catabolism, energy metabolism and immune response.

CPX-2625	DNA-directed RNA polymerase II complex	Catalyzes the transcription of RNA from a DNA template by acting as a nucleotidyl transferase that polymerizes ribonucleotides at the 3' end of an RNA transcript. Synthesizes precursors of mRNAs, and most snRNA and microRNAs. During a transcription cycle, Pol II, general transcription factors and the mediator complex assemble as the preinitiation complex (PIC) at the promoter. 11-15 base pairs of DNA surrounding the transcription start site are melted and the single-stranded DNA template strand of the promoter is positioned deeply within the central active site cleft of Pol II to form the open complex. After synthesis of about 30 bases of RNA, Pol II releases its contacts with the core promoter and the rest of the transcription machinery (promoter clearance) and enters the stage of transcription elongation in which it moves on the template as the transcript elongates. Pol II appears to oscillate between inactive and active conformations at each step of nucleotide addition.	Pol II complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:7227
CPX-2626	Outer dynein arm-docking complex	Mediates outer dynein arms (ODA) binding onto the doublet microtubule. The cilial/flagellar axoneme consists of 96nm repeat units, each of which contains four identical outer dynein arms and six unique inner dynein arms arranged in two rows along the length of the A-tubule. The dynein motors walk along the neighboring B-tubule to generate interdoublet sliding, which is transferred into bending by interdoublet linkers that resist the sliding. The Calaxin subunit may act to modulate complex activity depending on Ca2+ concentration and to stabilise its interaction with the doublet microtubule.	ODA-DC complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606

CPX-2628	DNA-directed RNA polymerase III complex	Catalyzes the transcription of RNA from an DNA template by acting as a nucleotidyl transferase that polymerizes ribonucleotides at the 3' end of an RNA transcript. Responsible for the transcription of genes encoding short non-coding RNAs, such as tRNA, 5S rRNA and U6 snRNA transcripts. Pol III machinery recognizes conserved promoter elements located within the transcribed region, generally the box A and box B sequences, which contribute to the D- and T-loops in the tRNA structure. POLR3F, POLR3G and POLR3C play a role in transcription initiation whereas the POLR3D-POLR3E heterodimer is crucial for the correct recognition of the termination signals of class III genes. POLR3K is required for RNA cleavage. Pol III initiation does not require ATP hydrolysis to open a transcription bubble to isolate and secure the template strand in the catalytic site and Pol III is capable of reinitiating transcription more rapidly on the same gene after the first transcription cycle without being released (facilitated reinitiation), resulting in a higher initiation efficiency; this appears to require an POLR3K-dependent conformational change of Pol III.

The E1 domain of DhaM catalyses the phosphoryl transfer from PEP to the small (9 kDa) soluble HPr (histidine-containing phosphoryl carrier protein) domain. Phosphorylated DhaM binds to ADP-bound DhaL and transiently phosphorylates the ADP. ATP-loaded DhaL associates with DhaK containing the Dha substrate covalently bound to His-218 through a hemiaminal bond.

CPX-26415	U6 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex	Non-coding RNA containing complex, part of the pre-B complex that acts as a chaperone for U6 spliceosomal-RNA. The spliceosome executes pre-mRNA splicing through a highly dynamic series of compositional and conformational transitions encompassing assembly, activation, catalysis and disassembly of a highly dynamic structure, involving the binding and release of the small nuclear RNAs (snRNA) and protein factors which remove intronic sequence from pre-mRNA. Spliceosome stages are characterized as E, A, B and remodelling of the pre-catalytic spliceosome (B complex) into the activated spliceosome (Bact complex) and subsequently, the catalytically activated spliceosome (B* complex) to carry out two RNA-catalysed transesterification reactions that lead to intron removal and splicing together of the flanking exon sequences.

CPX-271	5-hydroxytryptamine-3A/B receptor complex	Inward-rectifying, ligand-gated ion channel, which when activated by 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) causes fast neuronal depolarization and excitation or modulation of neurotransmitter release depending on their neuronal localisation (central and/or peripheral nervous system). A cation-specific, but otherwise relatively non-selective, ion channel with low conductance. Ca2+-permeability is related to subunit composition with 5HT3A homopentamers being more permeable than 5HT3A/B heteropentamers. Found pre- and post-synaptically but with different properties - pre-synaptic 5-HT3 receptors are predominantly calcium-permeant while post-synaptic receptors are permeant to Na+ and K+. Also Mg2+ permeant. Pre-synaptic depolarisations are generally slower than post-synaptic depolarisations. 5-HT3 receptors increase the frequency of spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic currents (sEPSCs) or miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs). These may be related to 5-HT3-induced depolarisation of pre-synaptic membranes and subsequent activation of cholinergic or glutamatergic neurotransmissions or evoked excitatory post-synaptic currents (eEPSCs) or spontaneous inhibitory post-synaptic currents (sIPSCs) related to GABAergic neurotransmissions post-synaptic 5-HT3 receptor activation. Due to different residues in transmembrane domain M2 of the 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B subunits the 5-HT3A/B heteromeric receptors are more efficient conductors than 5-HT3A homomeric receptors and have increased agonist and antagonist affinity. Homomeric receptors recover faster from desensitisation but are probably less prevalent in vivo. High levels of expression are found in the vagal terminals of the dorsal vagal complex where it is involved in the vomiting reflex (especially post-operative and chemotherapy- and radiation-induced vomiting and nausea), in the amygdala and the hippocampi. 5-HT3 receptor antagonists therefore act as effective anti-emetic drugs. Lower levels of expression are found in the forebrain with higher relative expression in the striatum than the cortical regions. Involved in processes associated with emotion, cognition, memory and pain perception. Involved in ganglionic transmission in the myenteric plexus in the mucosal layer and expressed in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract where serotonin mediates control over a variety of physiological functions such as the contraction/relaxation of smooth muscle, and peristaltic and secretory reflexes, directly or indirectly through intrinsic primary afferent neurons. Plays an important role in the regulation of inflammation and immune responses in the peripheral nervous system. Activation of 5-HT3 receptors on visceral afferents in some irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients results in visceral hypersensitivity. Chaperone proteins assist assembly, modifications and export from the ER followed by transport in vesicle-like structures along microtubules to the plasma membrane where they typically form clusters in F-actin-rich regions.	5-HT-3A/B receptor complex|5-HT-3A/B-R complex|5-HT-3A/BR complex|5-HT3-A/B receptor complex|5-HT3A/B receptor complex|5-HT3A/B-R complex|5-HT3A/BR complex|5-hydroxytryptamine 3A/B receptor complex|5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3A/B complex|5-hydroxytryptamine-3A/B cation channel receptor complex|5-hydroxytryptamine-3A/B cation-selective channel receptor complex|5-hydroxytryptamine-3A/b ion channel receptor complex|5-hydroxytryptamine-gated receptor 3A/B complex|5-hydroxytryptamine-gated receptor channel|5HT-3A/B receptor complex|5HT3-A/B receptor complex|5HT3A/B receptor complex|5HT3A/B-R complex|5HT3A/BR complex|HT-R3-A/B complex|HT-R3A/B complex|HTR3-A/B complex|HTR3A/B complex|Serotonin 3 (5-HT3) receptor|Serotonin 3A/B receptor complex|Serotonin receptor 3A/B complex|Serotonin-3A/B receptor complex|Serotonin-activated receptor 3A/B complex|Serotonin-gated receptor 3A/B complex|Serotonin-gated receptor channel		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606

These may be related to 5-HT3-induced depolarisation of pre-synaptic membranes and subsequent activation of cholinergic or glutamatergic neurotransmissions or evoked excitatory post-synaptic currents (eEPSCs) or spontaneous inhibitory post-synaptic currents (sIPSCs) related to GABAergic neurotransmissions post-synaptic 5-HT3 receptor activation. 5-HT3 receptors are highly expressed in the vagal terminals of the dorsal vagal complex where it is involved in the vomiting reflex (especially post-operative and chemotherapy- and radiation-induced vomiting and nausea). 5-HT3 receptor antagonists therefore act as effective anti-emetic drugs. 5-HT3D subunits are predominantly expressed in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract where serotonin mediates control over a variety of physiological functions such as the contraction/relaxation of smooth muscle, and peristaltic and secretory reflexes, directly or indirectly through intrinsic primary afferent neurons.

Activation of 5-HT3 receptors on visceral afferents in some irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients results in visceral hypersensitivity.

These may be related to 5-HT3-induced depolarisation of pre-synaptic membranes and subsequent activation of cholinergic or glutamatergic neurotransmissions or evoked excitatory post-synaptic currents (eEPSCs) or spontaneous inhibitory post-synaptic currents (sIPSCs) related to GABAergic neurotransmissions post-synaptic 5-HT3 receptor activation. High levels of expression are found in the vagal terminals of the dorsal vagal complex where it is involved in the vomiting reflex (especially post-operative and chemotherapy- and radiation-induced vomiting and nausea), in the amygdala and the hippocampi. 5-HT3 receptor antagonists therefore act as effective anti-emetic drugs. Lower levels of expression are found in the forebrain with higher relative expression in the striatum than the cortical regions. Involved in processes associated with emotion, cognition, memory and pain perception. Involved in ganglionic transmission in the myenteric plexus in the mucosal layer and expressed in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract serotonin mediates control over a variety of physiological functions such as the contraction/relaxation of smooth muscle, and peristaltic and secretory reflexes, directly or indirectly through intrinsic primary afferent neurons. Plays an important role in the regulation of inflammation and immune responses in the peripheral nervous system. Activation of 5-HT3 receptors on visceral afferents in some irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients results in visceral hypersensitivity. Chaperone proteins assist assembly, modifications and export from the ER followed by transport in vesicle-like structures along microtubules to the plasma membrane where they typically form clusters in F-actin-rich regions.	5-HT-3A/C receptor complex|5-HT-3A/C-R complex|5-HT-3A/CR complex|5-HT3-A/C receptor complex|5-HT3A/C receptor complex|5-HT3A/C-R complex|5-HT3A/CR complex|5-hydroxytryptamine 3A/C receptor complex|5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3A/C complex|5-hydroxytryptamine-3A/C cation channel receptor complex|5-hydroxytryptamine-3A/C cation-selective channel receptor complex|5-hydroxytryptamine-3A/C ion channel receptor complex|5-hydroxytryptamine-gated receptor 3A/C complex|5-hydroxytryptamine-gated receptor channel|5HT-3A/C receptor complex|5HT3-A/C receptor complex|5HT3A/C receptor complex|5HT3A/C-R complex|5HT3A/CR complex|HT-R3-A/C complex|HT-R3A/C complex|HTR3-A/C complex|HTR3A/C complex|Serotonin 3 (5-HT3) receptor|Serotonin 3A/C receptor complex|Serotonin receptor 3A/C complex|Serotonin-3A/C receptor complex|Serotonin-activated receptor 3A/C complex|Serotonin-gated receptor 3A/C complex|Serotonin-gated receptor channel		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606

A cation-specific, but otherwise relatively non-selective, ion channel with low conductance. Ca2+-permeability is related to subunit composition with 5HT3A homopentamers being more permeable than 5HT3A/B heteropentamers. Found pre- and post-synaptically but with different properties - pre-synaptic 5-HT3 receptors are predominantly calcium-permeant while post-synaptic receptors are permeant to Na+ and K+. Also Mg2+ permeant. Pre-synaptic depolarisations are generally slower than post-synaptic depolarisations. 5-HT3 receptors increase the frequency of spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic currents (sEPSCs) or miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs). These may be related to 5-HT3-induced depolarisation of pre-synaptic membranes and subsequent activation of cholinergic or glutamatergic neurotransmissions or evoked excitatory post-synaptic currents (eEPSCs) or spontaneous inhibitory post-synaptic currents (sIPSCs) related to GABAergic neurotransmissions post-synaptic 5-HT3 receptor activation. Due to different residues in transmembrane domain M2 of the 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B subunits the 5-HT3A/B heteromeric receptors are more efficient conductors than 5-HT3A homomeric receptors and have increased agonist and antagonist affinity. Homomeric receptors recover faster from desensitisation but are probably less prevalent in vivo. High levels of expression are found in the vagal terminals of the dorsal vagal complex, in the amygdala and the hippocampi.

Their many allosteric sites, which bind compounds with anticonvulsant, anti-anxiety, analgesic, sedative and anaesthetic properties make GABA-A receptors attractive drug targets.

CPX-2800	Snf1 protein kinase complex variant SIP2 	Energy sensor protein kinase complex, activated by glucose depletion. Regulates cellular energy metabolism by activating energy-producing pathways and inhibiting energy-consuming processes via derepression of glucose-repressed genes. Required for the diauxic shift, in which genes required for mitochondrial oxidative metabolism (normally repressed by glucose) are switched on; growth then resumes at a lower rate. Role in filamentous invasive growth, on glucose depletion, in haploid cells. The activity of this complex is modulated by reversible phosphorylation of SNF1 Thr-210 which increases in response to glucose starvation and correlates with large increases in cellular ADP-to-ATP and AMP-to-ATP ratios. Binding of ADP, but not AMP, to the complex protects against dephosphorylation of Thr-210, suggesting that ADP, rather than AMP, may be the critical activating signal. When glucose levels are high, the complex is cytoplasmic. Upon glucose depletion, SIP2-containing SNF1 remain in the cytosol.

CPX-2805	sTNF:TNR1B receptor-ligand complex	Complex formed on the binding of the soluble form of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, Tumour necrosis factor alpha (sTNFa, CPX-8826) to its type-2 receptor (TNFRSF1B, P20333). TNF, a key regulator of T regulatory cells, is mainly secreted by macrophages, T helper 1 and natural killer cells, and while TNFRSF1A (P19438) is ubiquitously expressed, TNFRSF1B is mainly expressed by immune cells, neurons and endothelial cells. TNFRSF1B is similar in its extracellular structure to TNFRSF1A at the mTNF (transmembrane TNF, CPX-8931) and sTNF binding sites, but it lacks the death domain (DD) found in TNFRSF1A that is central to its intracellular signalling activities. Instead, TNFRSF1B holds a TNF receptor associated factor (TRAF) binding site, allowing it to interact directly with TRAF2 and TRAF1 or TRAF3. Lacking the DD, TNFRSF1B cannot trigger cell death, instead uses TRAF to activate the NF-KB and MAPK signalling cascade, most frequently resulting in cell proliferation and survival. sTNF is relatively poor at activating TNFRSF1B but complex formation between mTNF and TNFRSF1B can induce reverse signalling where TNFRSF1B binding mTNF results in phosphorylation within the ligand-bearing cell, resulting in triggering the NF-KB signalling cascade. TNF-TNFRSF1B activation indirectly influences the formation of TNF-TNFRSF1A signalling complexes and the cross-talk between the receptor complexes is central to cell-survival, proliferation or death.

CPX-2808	Coagulation factor VIIa - tissue factor complex	A serine-type endopeptidase complex of the extrinsic blood coagulation pathway (tissue factor pathway) whose formation in the plasma membrane initiates the blood coagulation process by initiating the cell-surface assembly and propagation of the coagulation protease cascade. Activates coagulation factors IX (P00740) and X (P00742) by limited proteolysis to form active factors IXa (CPX-4945) and Xa (CPX-6215). Selectively cleavages of Arg-|-Ile bonds in factor X to form factor Xa. The coagulation pathway is terminated when fibrinogen is cleaved to fibrin which in turn polymerizes to produce a clot. Its zymogen form of factor VII is activated by selective cleavage of Arg-|-Ile bonds to form active factor VIIa. Activation is triggered by trauma and minor proteolysis by thrombin (FIIa, P00734), factor Xa (P00742), factor XIa (P03951) and factor XIIa (P00748). Also constitutively activated at very low levels.

The additional two electrons required to reduce the attacking O2 to two water molecules can originate from either the two-electron oxidation of Ni(I) to Ni(III) or the one-electron oxidation of Ni(II) to Ni(III) at the active site, the latter coupled to the one-electron oxidation of the [Fe4S4] medial cluster.

CPX-2825	ESCRT-0 complex, STAM variant	The ESCRT machinery, consisting of ESCRT-0 (this complex), -I, -II (CPX-2506), -III (CPX-329) and -IV (VPS4A/B complex, CPX-338) has been implicated in membrane scission steps, transforming a single, continuous bilayer into two distinct bilayers, either from within the neck of a vesicle budding away from the cytoplasm or from within a membrane tubule, while segregating cargo throughout the process. Membrane fission processes include: a) the sorting of multivesicular bodies (MVB) in the endocytic pathway; cargoes destined for inclusion into the MVB pathway are covalently modified with ubiquitin, recognized by ubiquitin-binding domains in the early ESCRTs (ESCRT-0, -I, and -II) and sequestered into endosomal microdomains that bud into the endosome as intralumenal vesicles aided by ESCRT-III, b) downregulation of cell-surface receptors, c) repair of plasma membrane wounds, d) abscission of the cellular bridge during cytokineses, d) nuclear envelope sealing by annular fusion and e) budding of virions (especially HIV-1) from the plasma membrane. The ESCRT machinery seems to play an indirect role in the proper functioning of cellular polarity and migration, the miRNA machinery and gene expression regulation. ESCRT-0 binds to and clusters ubiquitinated cargo for delivery into MVBs, and recruits clathrin, ubiquitin ligases, and deubiquitinating enzymes. ESCRT-0 recruits ESCRT-I which engages ESCRT-II to nucleate ESCRT-III polymerization. VPS4A/B complex, also known as ESCRT-IV, disassembles ESCRT-III to recycle its subunits. The ESCRT-III complex facilitates changes in membrane architecture by oligomerizing to form spiral, filament-like tubules, accumulation of which is associated with membrane constriction and fission.

The glutathionylation of IAN (GS-IAN) is driven by GSTU4, GS-IAN is converted to Cys(IAN), a process involving GPP1 (F4JTE7) which is recruited to this complex. CYP71B15 catalyzes two reactions, the formation of dihydrocamalexate from a indole-3-acetonitrile-cysteine conjugate and the oxidative decarboxylation of dihydrocamalexate which is the final step in camalexin biosynthesis.

CPX-2843	Ferrichrome outer membrane transporter complex	A member of the TonB-dependent transporter family (TBDTs) which binds and then transports hydroxamate siderophore ferrichrome (a ferric ion chelator) across the outer membrane. Sideraphore transport requires an outer membrane receptor (fhuA), which is relatively specific for its ligand. The ligand-bound receptor then physically interacts with the TonB protein. TBDTs are energy-dependent gated channels that usually transport large metal complexes which cannot fit through porins, and are too scarce to enter by mass-action-driven transport. Energy-dependent uptake through TBDTs requires interaction with tonB in complex with exbB and exbD in the inner membrane, ExbBD. TonB undergoes rapid energized movement driven by ExbBD which harvests the electrochemical force from the electrochemical proton gradient created by the proton gradient across the inner membrane and convert it into rotational motion. Hence, TonB may pull or twist the N-termini of TBDTs to promote transport of substrates into the periplasm. ATP-binding-cassette (ABC) transporters subsequently move the ferrichrome (Fe3+) through the periplasm and inner membrane. Also transports the antibiotic albomycin, a structural analog of ferrichrome, and acts as a receptor for colicin M, microcin J25 and bacteriophages T1, T5, phi80 and UC-1	Iron (III) hydroxamate ABC transporter		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:83333

Calcium is required for high affinity binding to GABA. Plays a critical role in the fine-tuning of inhibitory synaptic transmission. Pre-synaptic GABA receptor inhibits neurotransmitter release by down-regulating high-voltage activated calcium channels, whereas postsynaptic GABA receptor decreases neuronal excitability by activating a prominent inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) conductance that underlies the late inhibitory postsynaptic potentials.

CPX-3068	Inward rectifier potassium channel 2 complex	Inward rectifier potassium channel Kir2.1 (coded for by the KCNJ2 gene) plays a key role in maintaining the correct resting potential in eukaryotic cells. The Kir2.1 channel is characterized by a strong inward rectification, in which K+ ions flow preferentially into rather than out of the cell. Their voltage dependence is regulated by the concentration of extracellular potassium; as external potassium is raised, the voltage range of the channel opening shifts to more positive voltages. Inward rectification is produced by cytosolic polyamines and Mg2+ occluding the ion conductance pathway as K+ ions are flowing outward. These positively charged particles are then removed from the pore when K+ ions flow into the cell. Rectification is the primary means of gating for Kir2 channels. In addition to rectification, another common feature of Kir channels is regulation by the membrane phospholipid PIP2.

CPX-3071	Inward rectifier potassium channel 2 complex	Inward rectifier potassium channel Kir2.1 (coded for by the KCNJ2 gene) plays a key role in maintaining the correct resting potential and action potential duration in eukaryotic cells. The Kir2.1 channel is characterized by a strong inward rectification, in which K+ ions flow preferentially into rather than out of the cell. Their voltage dependence is regulated by the concentration of extracellular potassium; as external potassium is raised, the voltage range of the channel opening shifts to more positive voltages. Inward rectification is produced by cytosolic polyamines and Mg2+ occluding the ion conductance pathway as K+ ions are flowing outward. These positively charged particles are then removed from the pore when K+ ions flow into the cell. Rectification is the primary means of gating for Kir2 channels. In addition to rectification, another common feature of Kir channels is regulation by the membrane phospholipid PIP2. Opening of Kir channels requires PIP2 binding to basic and polar amino acids in the cytoplasmic domains, whereas depletion of PIP2 seems to close the channel. Expressed in brain, heart and skeletal muscle.	IRK2 complex|Kir2.1 complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606

CPX-3092	Ryanodine 1 complex	A large homotetrameric intracellular calcium channel predominantly of the skeletal muscle that is crucial for excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling. Following the depolarization of the transverse tubule (T-tubule) membrane, RyR1 opening releases Ca2+ stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) into the myoplasm. This increase of cytoplasmic Ca2+ triggers the interaction of actin and myosin that causes contraction of the muscle fibers. Implicated in skeletal muscle development, ossification, dermatogenesis and cardiovascular development. Expressed in the brain, where it can mediate the NO-induced release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores in neurons. The E-C coupling involves the mechanical interaction between RyR1 in the SR and DHPR (also known as L-type Ca2+ channel, CPX-3191) in the T-tubule. There is some evidence to suggest that this happens through the direct physical interaction of the two channels. FKBP12 binds and co-purifies with RyR1, but the intrinsic isomerase activity is not essential for RyR effects. FKBP is believed to physically stabilize the coordinated gating of the four RyRs in one RyR homotetramer and may be involved in the physical coupling between RyR tetramers. RyR1 physically interacts with various other proteins, small molecules and ions that modulate its activity: Low Ca+2 concentration activates RyR1, by binding to specific high-affinity Ca+2 sites. High Ca+2 concentration inhibits RyR1, by binding to less specific low-affinity Ca+2 sites. S100A1 binds speciﬁcally to the puriﬁed RyR1 in a Ca2+ dependent manner, at regions overlapping with CaM binding sites, and enhances the open probability of RyR1 reconstituted in lipid bilayers. TRDN, ASPH, CACNA1S, Homer-1c and ATP stimulates RyR1 channel activity. Calmodulin with bound calcium inhibits the RYR1 channel activity, as is binding to magnesium ions (Mg+2).

CPX-312	Amiloride-sensitive sodium channel complex, delta-alpha-beta-gamma	Inward cation channel with high sodium selectivity but also permeable to lithium. Activated under low extracellular sodium concentrations and low extracellular pH and self-inhibited by high extracellular sodium concentrations. Activation is dependent on proteolytic cleavage of alpha and gamma subunits, post-translational modifications (such as glycosylation of beta subunit and palmitoylation) and possibly cyclic nucleotides that lift self-inhibition. Regulated by hormones such as aldosterone and vasopressin and inhibited by the diuretic amiloride. Although the channel activity itself is not voltage-gated, ameloride-sensitivity may be voltage-dependent. Channel gating and conductance are comparatively slow. Plays an essential role in electrolyte and blood pressure homeostasis, but also in airway surface liquid (ASL) homeostasis, which is important for proper clearance of mucus and pathogens. Mutations leading to a loss of ASL homeostatis are a trigger for cystic fibrosis. The inward sodium transport may trigger action potentials in neurons by gradually depolarizing membrane potentials. In nephrons may also be activated by shear stress potentially changing the conformation of the bulky extracellular loop or the transmembrane domains and thereby increasing channel opening times. May also play a role in salt and sour taste perception. Found in the apical membrane of many epithelial cell types, especially in the Aldosterone Sensitive Distal Nephron (ASDN), kidney, colon, lung and sweat glands but also in heart, liver, pancreas, skeletal muscle and blood leukocytes. Also expressed in vascular endothelia where their mechanical properties and function differ from epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs) in other tissues: vascular endothelia are ‘leaky’, allowing passive sodium transport through the membrane. Here, ENaCs are activated by increased external sodium concentrations that enhances the sodium influx into the cell. May stabilize F-actin through strengthening of the inter-subunits causing swelling or stiffening of endothelia and which can ultimately lead to hypertension.

CPX-3135	Ryanodine 1 complex	A large homotetrameric intracellular calcium channel predominantly of the skeletal muscle that is crucial for excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling. Following the depolarization of the transverse tubule (T-tubule) membrane, RyR1 opening releases Ca2+ stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) into the myoplasm. This increase of cytoplasmic Ca2+ triggers the interaction of actin and myosin that causes contraction of the muscle fibers. Implicated in skeletal muscle development, ossification, dermatogenesis and cardiovascular development. Expressed in the brain, where it can mediate the NO-induced release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores in neurons. The E-C coupling involves the mechanical interaction between RyR1 in the SR and DHPR (also known as L-type Ca2+ channel, CPX-3192) in the T-tubule. There is some evidence to suggest that this happens through the direct physical interaction of the two channels. FKBP12 binds and co-purifies with RyR1, but the intrinsic isomerase activity is not essential for RyR effects. FKBP is believed to physically stabilize the coordinated gating of the four RyRs in one RyR homotetramer and may be involved in the physical coupling between RyR tetramers. RyR1 physically interacts with various other proteins, small molecules and ions that modulate its activity: Low Ca+2 concentration activates RyR1, by binding to specific high-affinity Ca+2 sites. High Ca+2 concentration inhibits RyR1, by binding to less specific low-affinity Ca+2 sites. S100A1 binds speciﬁcally to the puriﬁed RyR1 in a Ca2+ dependent manner, at regions overlapping with CaM binding sites, and enhances the open probability of RyR1 reconstituted in lipid bilayers. TRDN, ASPH, CACNA1S, Homer-1 and ATP stimulates RyR1 channel activity. Calmodulin with bound calcium inhibits the RYR1 channel activity, as is binding to magnesium ions (Mg+2).

CPX-3137	Ryanodine 2 complex	A large homotetrameric intracellular calcium channel predominantly of the cardiac muscle that is crucial for excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling. Following the depolarization of the transverse tubule (T-tubule) membrane, RyR2 opening releases Ca2+ stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) into the myoplasm. This increase of cytoplasmic Ca2+ triggers the interaction of actin and myosin that causes contraction of the cardiac muscle fibers. The E-C coupling in cardiac muscle involves RyR2 calcium release triggered by Ca2+ influx due to activation of the L-type calcium channel Cav1.2 (CPX-3194). RyR2 is required for heart development. Aberrant channel activation can lead to cardiac arrhythmia. RyR2 is also shown to play a role in beta cells survival in vitro. RyR2 physically interacts with various other proteins, small molecules and ions that modulate its activity: Low Ca+2 concentration activates RyR2, by binding to specific high-affinity Ca+2 sites. High Ca+2 concentration inhibits RyR2, by binding to less specific low-affinity Ca+2 sites. PKA binds to RyR2 altering the gating. S100A1 binding enhances the open probability of RyR2. ASPH and ATP stimulates RyR2 channel activity. Magnesium ions (Mg+2) inhibits the RyR2 channel activity. Homer-1c binding inhibits RyR2 channel opening. Calmodulin binding may inhibit open basal probability and alter the Ca-dependent activation of RyR2. FKBP binding is believed to physically stabilize the coordinated gating of the four RyRs in one RyR homotetramer and may be involved in the physical coupling between RyR tetramers. Binding to Sorcin decreases open channel probability. CaMKIId binds and phosphorylates RyR2 strongly activating Ca2+ release during both diastole and systole. An immunoprecipitation study of recombinant heterologously expressed RyRs provided evidence that RyR2 could form heterotetramers with RyR1 and RyR3. However, the presence of native tissue RyR heterotetramers has not been reported yet.

Recruited by the Shu complex (CPX-3087) to the sites of single-stranded DNA gaps left by replication-blocking lesions to complete error-free DNA-damage tolerance. Counteracts the anti-recombination activity of the SRS2 helicase (P12954) by associating with the RAD51 (P25454)-ssDNA filament, rendering it more stable than a nucleoprotein filament containing RAD51 alone. stimulates RAD51 filament assembly onto RPA-coated single-stranded DNA. The RAD51/RAD55-AD57 co-filament resists disruption by the SRS2 anti-recombinase by blocking SRS2 translocation. The complex is also involved in double-strand break repair.

CPX-314	Amiloride-sensitive sodium channel complex, alpha-beta-gamma	Inward cation channel with high sodium selectivity but also permeable to lithium. Activated under low extracellular sodium concentrations and self-inhibited by high extracellular sodium concentrations. Activation is dependent on proteolytic cleavage of alpha and gamma subunits, post-translational modifications (such as glycosylation of beta subunit and palmitoylation) and possibly cyclic nucleotides that lift self-inhibition. Regulated by hormones such as aldosterone and vasopressin and inhibited by the diuretic amiloride. Although the channel activity itself is not voltage-gated, ameloride-sensitivity may be voltage-dependent. Channel gating and conductance are comparatively slow. Plays an essential role in electrolyte and blood pressure homeostasis, but also in airway surface liquid (ASL) homeostasis, which is important for proper clearance of mucus and pathogens. Mutations leading to a loss of ASL homeostatis are a trigger for cystic fibrosis. The inward sodium transport may trigger action potentials in neurons by gradually depolarizing membrane potentials. In nephrons may also be activated by shear stress potentially changing the conformation of the bulky extracellular loop or the transmembrane domains and thereby increasing channel opening times. May also play a role in salt and sour taste perception. Found in the apical membrane of many epithelial cell types, especially in the Aldosterone Sensitive Distal Nephron (ASDN), kidney, colon, lung and sweat glands but also in heart, liver, pancreas, skeletal muscle and blood leukocytes. Also expressed in vascular endothelia where their mechanical properties and function differ from epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs) in other tissues: vascular endothelia are ‘leaky’, allowing passive sodium transport through the membrane. Here, ENaCs are activated by increased external sodium concentrations that enhances the sodium influx into the cell. May stabilize F-actin through strengthening of the inter-subunits.

CPX-315	Amiloride-sensitive sodium channel complex, alpha-beta-gamma	Inward cation channel with high sodium selectivity but also permeable to lithium. Activated under low extracellular sodium concentrations and self-inhibited by high extracellular sodium concentrations. Activation is dependent on proteolytic cleavage of alpha and gamma subunits, post-translational modifications (such as glycosylation of beta subunit and palmitoylation) and possibly cyclic nucleotides that lift self-inhibition. Regulated by hormones such as aldosterone and vasopressin and inhibited by the diuretic amiloride. Although the channel activity itself is not voltage-gated, ameloride-sensitivity may be voltage-dependent. Channel gating and conductance are comparatively slow. Plays an essential role in electrolyte and blood pressure homeostasis, but also in airway surface liquid (ASL) homeostasis, which is important for proper clearance of mucus and pathogens. Mutations leading to a loss of ASL homeostatis are a trigger for cystic fibrosis. The inward sodium transport may trigger action potentials in neurons by gradually depolarizing membrane potentials. In nephrons may also be activated by shear stress potentially changing the conformation of the bulky extracellular loop or the transmembrane domains and thereby increasing channel opening times. May also play a role in salt and sour taste perception. Found in the apical membrane of many epithelial cell types, especially in the Aldosterone Sensitive Distal Nephron (ASDN), kidney, colon, lung and sweat glands but also in heart, liver, pancreas, skeletal muscle and blood leukocytes. Also expressed in vascular endothelia where their mechanical properties and function differ from epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs) in other tissues: vascular endothelia are ‘leaky’, allowing passive sodium transport through the membrane. Here, ENaCs are activated by increased external sodium concentrations that enhances the sodium influx into the cell. May stabilize F-actin through strengthening of the inter-subunits.

Acetylation of histone H4 is essential for DNA double-strand break repair through homologous recombination. Involved in cell cycle progression.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:559292
CPX-3156	Ryanodine 2 complex	A large homotetrameric intracellular calcium channel predominantly of the cardiac muscle that is crucial for excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling. Following the depolarization of the transverse tubule (T-tubule) membrane, RyR2 opening releases Ca2+ stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) into the myoplasm. This increase of cytoplasmic Ca2+ triggers the interaction of actin and myosin that causes contraction of the cardiac muscle fibers. The E-C coupling in cardiac muscle involves RyR2 calcium release triggered by Ca2+ influx due to activation of the L-type calcium channel Cav1.2 (CPX-3195). RyR2 is required for heart development. Aberrant channel activation can lead to cardiac arrhythmia. RyR2 is also shown to play a role in beta cell survival in vitro. RyR2 physically interacts with various other proteins, small molecules and ions that modulate its activity: Low Ca+2 concentration activates RyR2, by binding to specific high-affinity Ca+2 sites. High Ca+2 concentration inhibits RyR2, by binding to less specific low-affinity Ca+2 sites. PKA binds to RyR2 altering the gating. S100A1 binding enhances the open probability of RyR2. ASPH and ATP stimulates RyR2 channel activity. Magnesium ions (Mg+2) inhibits the RyR2 channel activity. Homer-1c binding inhibits RyR2 channel opening. Calmodulin binding may inhibit open basal probability and alter the Ca-dependent activation of RyR2. FKBP binding is believed to physically stabilize the coordinated gating of the four RyRs in one RyR homotetramer and may be involved in the physical coupling between RyR tetramers. Binding to sorcin decreases open channel probability. CaMKIId binds and phosphorylates RyR2 strongly activating Ca2+ release during both diastole and systole.

CPX-3157	Ryanodine 3 complex	A large homotetrameric intracellular calcium channel, member of the ryanodine receptors family, responsible for the release of Ca2+ from the SR in muscle cells, thereby triggering muscle fiber contraction.

Predominantly expressed in the diaphragm muscles, smooth muscle cells and in the brain (mainly in hippocampus, thalamus, Purkinje cells, corpus striatum) and in low levels in many other organs.

CPX-3158	SPOTS complex	Serine C-palmitoyltransferase (SPT) catalyzes the first committed step in the biosynthesis of sphingolipids: condensation of serine with palmitoyl-CoA to form 3-ketosphinganine. The catalytic activity depends on LCB1 and LCB2, and is stimulated several-fold by TSC3. The remaining components are believed to play regulatory roles. Mature sphingolipids are an essential component of the plasma membrane. Moreover, several intermediates in sphingolipid metabolism are important signaling molecules involved in control of growth and stress response. Tight regulation of this rate-limiting step in sphingolipid synthesis is therefore critical for lipid homeostasis, membrane biogenesis, protein quality control and trafficking through the secretory pathway. Regulation of sphingolipid synthesis is mediated by phosphorylation of ORM1 and ORM2 as well as by up-regulation of ORM2 protein levels. Sphingolipid depletion activates the TORC2 complex (CPX-1717), which triggers ORM1 and ORM2 phosphorylation by the protein kinase YPK1 (P12688). Inhibition of the nutrient-sensitive TORC1 complex (CPX-1715 /CPX-1716) triggers phosphorylation of ORM proteins by the protein kinase NPR1 (P22211). Increased phosphorylation of ORM proteins reduces their inhibitory activity resulting in stimulation of SPOTS and increased sphingolipid synthesis. In addition, the presence of the phosphoinositide phosphatase SAC1 (P32368) in the SPOTS complex appears to link sphingolipid synthesis to phosphoinositide signaling that controls ER functions and ER-to-Golgi traffic. Thus, the SPOTS complex may be responsible for coordinating sphingolipid homeostasis with a variety of processes that control cell growth and response to nutrients.

MAT I is present in lower amounts than MAT III and is probably predominantly responsible for S-adenosylmethionine biosynthesis under normal conditions.

CPX-3174	raps-insc complex	Required for the asymmetric division of neuroblasts. Coordinates asymmetric localization of cell fate determinants with orientation of the mitotic spindle resulting in different daughter cells upon division. Localizes at the apical cortex of the neuroblast: Raps maintains, but does not initiate, Insc apically, while Insc segregates Raps asymmetrically. Requires the G protein alpha i subunit (Galphai, P20353) for partial activity resulting in the selective recruitment of Discs large 1 (Dlg1, P31007) but not Mushroom body defect (Mud, Q8IR55). This ensures that the spindle is attached to the cortex (via Dlg) before activation of spindle pulling forces by Dynein/Dynactin (via Mud). The selective recruitment of Dlg1 occurs by a steric mechanism: Insc and Mud compete for binding to the tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs, IPR019734) of Raps. Complex activity appears to be conserved. Mammalian Insc (Q1MX18) functions similar to Insc, GPSM1 (also called AGS3, Q86YR5) and GPSM2 (also called LGN, P81274) to Raps, and NuMA (Q14980) to Mud.

Helicase activity of the degradosome is more efficient with substrates with 3'-overhangs, and requires the presence of DSS1. Unprocessed rRNA and mRNA accumulate in cells lacking degradosome activity, however, tRNA maturation is unaffected, indicating that this complex is not directly involved in RNA processing. Instead, the degradosome complex is likely part of the mitochondrial RNA surveillance system, which degrades aberrant and unprocessed RNAs.	mtEXO complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:559292
CPX-3181	aubergine-tudor complex	Required for gametogenesis. PIWI proteins associate specifically with PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), small RNAs expressed predominantly in germlines, and silence transposable DNA elements, thus maintaining the integrity of the genome and the development of gametes. The presence of Tudor in the complex appears to be required for the quality control of transposon-derived piRNAs. Symmetric dimethylated arginines (sDMA) result from methylation of Aub by dPRMT5 (csul, Q9U6Y9) and act as binding sites for Tud domains.

CPX-3186	Amylin receptor 2 complex	A transmembrane, G-protein-coupled signalling receptor complex that serves as receptor for the amylin polypeptides (Amy). Amylin is produced in beta-islet cells of the pancreas. It is implicated in selective inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose utilization and glycogen deposition in muscle, gastric emptying, gastric acid secretion, postprandial glucagon secretion and food intake and aids weight loss. CALCR only acts as amylin receptor when bound by RAMP proteins. In the absence of RAMP proteins, CALCR functions as calcitonin receptor. Unlike the calcitonin receptor-like receptors (CPX-2189, CPX-2191, CPX-3148), the calcitonin receptor can migrate to the plasma membrane without guidance from RAMP proteins.

The abnormal stalled ribosome is recognized and ubiquitinated at one or more specific residues by the E3 ubiquitin ligase HEL2 (Q05580) . Ribosome ubiquitination induces subunit dissociation by the RQT complex (CPX-6643).

CPX-3268	Cyclin-dependent protein kinase-activating kinase complex	Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activation minimally depends on two events: binding to a cyclin and phosphorylation of a conserved Thr residue in the activation (T) loop. CAK activates the cyclin-associated kinases CDK1 (P11440), CDK2 (P97377), CDK4 (P30285) and CDK6 Q64261) by threonine phosphorylation, thus regulating cell cycle progression. CAK activity is itself regulated throughout the cell cycle by T-loop phosphorylation of CDK7 on Thr-170. Phosphorylation of Ser-164 during mitosis inactivates the enzyme. In the transcription cycle, CAK serine phosphorylates the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (POLR2A, P08775) and other proteins, as part of the general transcription factor TFIIH. Phosphorylation of POLR2A in complex with DNA promotes transcription initiation by triggering dissociation from DNA.

Also active in the insulin signalling pathway, mTOR pathway and other tumorigenesis promoting pathways. The activation of IKBKB and presence of NEMO are required for the canonical NF-kappaB pathway triggered by proinflammatory stimuli while the activation of CHUK is required for the alternative NF-kappaB pathway triggered by a multitude of ligands. The kinase subunits are activated by phosphorylation on Ser-177 and Ser-181 of Ikbkb/Ikkb and Ser-176 and Ser-180 of Chuk/Ikka.

CPX-3271	KCNQ1-KCNE1 I(Ks) channel complex	A voltage-gated K+ channel that produces the delayed rectifier, slow K+ current (IKs) in cardiac myocytes. IKs is a major repolarization current in the heart that responds rapidly and robustly to sympathetic nervous system stimulation. Binding of beta subunit MinK (KCNE1) modifies the gating properties of the channel: it increases the single channel conductance, slows the rate of activation and removes (or greatly slows) inactivation of KCNQ1 alpha subunits.

CPX-3272	CENP-A recruiting complex	Orchestrates the deposition of CENP-A, the centromere-specific histone H3 variant which is required for recruitment and assembly of kinetochore proteins, mitotic progression and chromosome segregation. The redistribution of CENP-A nucleosomes between the two new DNA strands is necessary to maintain the epigenetic mark of the centromere and leads to the dilution of CENP-A nucleosomes. The Mis18 complex localizes to centromeres just prior to the pre-nucleosomal HJURP/CENP-A/H4 complex and is absolutely required for the CENP-A-specific chaperone, Holliday junction recognition protein (HJURP, Q8NCD3) to reach the centromeres. CDK phosphorylation of MISBP1 during G2 and mitosis, prior to the metaphase-to-anaphase transition, negatively regulates complex assembly.

Inward rectifier potassium channels are characterized by a greater tendency to allow potassium to flow into the cell rather than out of it. I(KACh) is expressed in cardiac muscle, specifically the sinoatrial node and atria. Regulation of I(KACh) via G protein-coupled receptor signaling underlies the control of heart rate.

CPX-328	Atg12-Atg5-Atg16l1 complex	Essential for autophagy during nutrient deprivation, a catabolic process that sequesters undesired cellular material into autophagosomes for delivery to lysosomes for degradation. Required for the elongation of isolation membranes (phagophores). Acts as an E3-like enzyme to recruit the E2-like protein Atg3, conjugated to LC3-I, to the endoplasmic reticulum-derived omegasome. Atg3 binds to and is activated by Atg12, facilitating conjugation of the LC3 to phosphatidylethanolamine, thus converting LC3-I to LC3-II. Therefore, the site of Atg12-Atg5-Atg16l1 complex recruitment determines the site of LC3-II formation. The LC3 family is required for phagophore expansion, closure, and cargo recruitment.

CPX-3280	Cardiac Troponin complex	Regulates contraction-relaxation cycles in response to changes in intracellular calcium. Together with tropomyosin, cTn is generally located along polymerised actin, which forms the backbone of the cardiomyocyte thin filament. At resting levels of intracellular calcium, the cTn complex keeps tropomyosin in a position that prevents force-producing interactions between myosin heads and actin. When the muscle cell is stimulated to contract by an action potential, calcium channels open in the sarcoplasmic membrane and release calcium into the sarcoplasm. Some of this calcium binds to specific sites in the N-domain of TnC, triggering a series of protein structural changes and tropomyosin is rolled away from myosin-binding sites on actin, allowing myosin to attach to the thin filament and produce force and/or shorten the sarcomere of the cardiomyocyte.	cTn|cTnC:cTnI:cTnT		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606
CPX-3281	Mitochondrial proton-transporting ATP synthase complex	Acts to convert the energy of oxidation-reduction reactions of the electron transport chain (respiration) to the phosphorylation of ADP. The synthesis of ATP is coupled to the respiratory chain via the proton potential. The ATP synthase is a molecular motor composed of two separable parts: F1 and F0. The F1 portion contains the catalytic sites for ATP synthesis and protrudes into the mitochondrial matrix. F0 forms a proton turbine that is embedded in the inner membrane and connected to the rotor of F1. The flux of protons flowing down a potential gradient powers the rotation of the rotor driving the synthesis of ATP. Thus, the flow of protons though F0 is coupled to the synthesis of ATP.

CPX-3284	Nucleolar ribonuclease MRP complex	Site-specific endonuclease, closely related to RNAse P complex (CPX-1873). Most protein subunits are common between the two complexes, only SNM1 and RNP1 are unique to MRP, as well as the RNA component NME1. RNAse MRP is involved in rRNA processing in the nucleolus, but during exit from mitosis it also localizes to specialized cytoplasmic P bodies and participates in cleaving CLB2 mRNA. The RNA subunit NME1 is a catalytically active ribozyme that is capable of both recognizing and cleaving substrates, Despite its name (Mitochondrial RNA Processing) the nucleolar complex is not involved in processing mitochondrial RNA.

CPX-3285	HSP90B-CDC37 chaperone complex	A protein kinase chaperone complex required for the proper folding, maturation and stabilization of target proteins (mostly signalling protein kinases, some steroid hormone receptors), usually during or immediately after completion of translation. The highly conserved, phosphorylated CDC37-Ser13 is essential for complex assembly and target protein binding. CDC37-Ser13 is phosphorylated by Casein kinase II (CK2), which in turn is a target of CDC37 creating a positive feedback loop. CDC37-Ser13 is de-phosphorylated by PP5 (P53041). Target proteins are recognised by the CDC37 subunit. HSP90 does not bind any particular motif but rather associates with intrinsically unstable kinases. Complex binding also prevents rapid ubiquitin-dependent proteosomal degradation of target proteins.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606
CPX-3286	SMAD3-SMAD4 complex	A transcription factor complex which binds to the promoters of target genes and recruits co-activators and histone acetyltransferases, such as p300, CBP and P300/CBP-associated factor, facilitating transcription. In response to TGF-beta/activin-family protein binding, TGF-beta type II receptors phosphorylate TGF-beta type I receptors (Alk4, 5 and 7) which in turn phosphorylates Smad3 on Ser-423 and Ser-425. This enables binding to Smad4 to form heteromeric Smad complexes that enter the nucleus to initiate gene transcription. Because of their relatively low DNA-binding affinity, Smad complexes interact with a wide variety of DNA-binding proteins. Crosstalk with other signalling pathways and interaction with other DNA-binding cofactors define the specific binding patterns of Smads; in addition, interaction with coactivators/corepressors modulates their transcriptional activity.

CPX-329	ESCRT-III complex	The ESCRT machinery, consisting of ESCRT-0, -I, -II (CPX-2506.), -III (this complex) and -IV (VPS4A/B complex, CPX-338) has been implicated in membrane scission steps, transforming a single, continuous bilayer into two distinct bilayers, either from within the neck of a vesicle budding away from the cytoplasm or from within a membrane tubule, while segregating cargo throughout the process. Membrane fission processes include: a) the sorting of multivesicular bodies (MVB) in the endocytic pathway; cargoes destined for inclusion into the MVB pathway are covalently modified with ubiquitin, recognized by ubiquitin-binding domains in the early ESCRTs (ESCRT-0, -I, and -II) and sequestered into endosomal microdomains that bud into the endosome as intralumenal vesicles aided by ESCRT-III, b) downregulation of cell-surface receptors, c) repair of plasma membrane wounds, d) abscission of the cellular bridge during cytokineses, d) nuclear envelope sealing by annular fusion and e) budding of virions (especially HIV-1) from the plasma membrane. The ESCRT machinery seems to play an indirect role in the proper functioning of cellular polarity and migration, the miRNA machinery and gene expression regulation. ESCRT-0 binds to and clusters ubiquitinated cargo for delivery into MVBs, and recruits clathrin, ubiquitin ligases, and deubiquitinating enzymes.. ESCRT-0 recruits ESCRT-I which engages ESCRT-II to nucleate ESCRT-III polymerization. VPS4A/B complex, also known as ESCRT-IV, disassembles ESCRT-III to recycle its subunits. The ESCRT-III complex facilitates changes in membrane architecture by oligomerizing to form spiral, filament-like tubules, accumulation of which is associated with membrane constriction and fission. Disassembly of ESCRT-III by VPS4A/B may be a required step for fission. CHMP1A, CHMP1B and CHMP5 are sometimes regarded as ESCRT-III accessory proteins rather than full complex members, suggesting that multiple variants with different core components and/or associated auxiliary factors may exist within the same cell and be active in different processes.

Est1 and TLC1 are sufficient for telomerase activity in vitro, but in vivo all 4 subunits are required. Although telomerase activity can be detected throughout the cell cycle, telomeres are only elongated in late S-phase.

Binding of the ligand AMP in response to atrial distension (high blood volume) plays a major role in the regulation of blood pressure and salt-fluid volume homeostasis. Binding of ANP to ANPR-A dimer activates the receptor and stimulates its guanylate cyclase activity, thereby elevating intracellular cGMP levels. cGMP, in return mediates the hormonal actions through cGMP-regulated ion channels, protein kinases and phosphodiesterases.

CHMP1A, CHMP1B and CHMP5 are sometimes regarded as ESCRT-III accessory proteins rather than full complex members, suggesting that multiple variants with different core components and/or associated auxiliary factors may exist within the same cell and be active in different processes.

CPX-333	ESCRT-III complex, variant Chmp1b2	The ESCRT machinery has been implicated in membrane scission steps, transforming a single, continuous bilayer into two distinct bilayers, either from within the neck of a vesicle budding away from the cytoplasm or from within a membrane tubule, while segregating cargo throughout the process. Membrane fission processes include: a) the sorting of multivesicular bodies (MVB) in the endocytic pathway; cargoes destined for inclusion into the MVB pathway are covalently modified with ubiquitin, recognized by ubiquitin-binding domains in the early ESCRTs (ESCRT-0, -I, and -II) and sequestered into endosomal microdomains that bud into the endosome as intralumenal vesicles aided by ESCRT-III, b) downregulation of cell-surface receptors, c) repair of plasma membrane wounds, d) abscission of the cellular bridge during cytokineses, d) nuclear envelope sealing by annular fusion and e) budding of virions from the plasma membrane. The ESCRT machinery seems to play an indirect role in the proper functioning of cellular polarity and migration, the miRNA machinery and gene expression regulation. ESCRT-0 recruits ESCRT-I which engages ESCRT-II to nucleate ESCRT-III polymerization. VPS4A/B complex, also known as ESCRT-IV, disassembles ESCRT-III to recycle its subunits. The ESCRT-III complex facilitates changes in membrane architecture by oligomerizing to form spiral, filament-like tubules, accumulation of which is associated with membrane constriction and fission.

CPX-334	VPS4 complex	An AAA-ATPase that is probably the main energy-providing system for the membrane deformation and abscission function of the ESCRT machinery consisting of ESCRT-0 (CPX-1622), -I (CPX-940), -II (CPX-1623), -III (CPX-1624) and -IV (this complex) . Required for the dissociation and recycling of ESCRT-III complex subunits from vesicle and plasma membranes as well as the midbody during the final stages of cytokinesis where it causes constriction of the ESCRT-III polymer and fission of the associated membrane neck. Multiple disassembly reactions are performed until ESCRT-III dissociation has been completed. VPS4 ATPase activity is regulated by a) ESCRT-III interactions with VPS4 which enhance ATP hydrolysis by relieving autoinhibition of the AAA domain and b) binding of the VTA1 homodimers (Q06263) which both promotes VPS4 oligomerization and enhances ATP hydrolysis. Binding of ESCRT-III subunits DID2 (P69771) or VPS60 (Q03390) to the amino-terminal of VTA1 relieves autoinhibition within VTA1 to further enhance stimulation of VPS4 ATP hydrolysis. Binding of IST1 (P53843) to VPS4 negatively regulates VPS4 activity by blocking binding to the ESCRT machinery.

CPX-3381	Egg-3/4/5 MBK-2 complex	Pseudophosphatase complex required for oocyte-to-zygote transition. Components of the complex sequester and modulate the kinase activity of mbk-2 before and during the early phases of meiosis to regulate oocyte maturation and egg activation. The complex localises to the cortex of the oocyte before the meiotic divisions and it is retained there during the early meiotic divisions. The inactive phosphatases egg-3, egg-4 and egg-5 are required for the cortical localisation of mbk-2. In particular, egg-3 acts as scaffold to tether mbk-2, egg-4 and egg-5 to the oocyte cortex, and thus restricts mbk-2 activity to the cortex during meiosis I. egg-4 and egg-5 bind to mbk-2 and inhibit its kinase activity. egg-3 does not affect mbk-2 activity. During anaphase of meiosis I, egg-3 relocalises to the cytoplasm and is targeted for degradation by the Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (CPX-3382). This releases mbk-2 from the complex to modify the oocyte proteins required after meiosis.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:6239
CPX-3382	Anaphase-promoting complex	APC, a key regulator of cell cycle progression, is a conserved E3 ubiqutin ligase which facilitates multiubiqutination of cell cycle proteins, including cyclins, so marking them for proteasomal destruction. Generally believed that APC acts as a scaffold that brings E2 enzymes and substrates into close proximity. APC activity is required for metaphase-anaphase transition, mitotic exit, G1 phase and DNA replication. Acts by mediating the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of target proteins. Has a developmental role in early embryogenesis and the metaphase to anaphase transition in oocyte and spermatocyte meiosis and mitosis in germ cells. Required for embryonic anterior-posterior axis formation. Involved in regulating GABA neurotransmitter release at neuromuscular junctions in GABA motor neurons. In particular, targets the inactive phosphatase egg-3, a component of the Egg-3/4/5 MBK-2 complex (CPX-3381), which is involved in oocyte-to-zygote transition, for degradation by the proteasome during meiotic divisions.

The substrate recognition subunit binds substrates, positioning them for ubiquitination by ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) that bind to the complex through the E3 ubiquitin ligase rbx-1 (Q23457). The complex plays a role in sex-determination, specifically regulating male sexual development.

CPX-3384	LAS1 RNA processome complex	Endonuclease responsible for the removal of the second internal transcribed spacer region (ITS2) from 35S pre-ribosomal RNA, located between the 5.8S and 25S rRNA. LAS1 within this complex functions as RNA endonuclease, which cleaves at site C2, yielding a 2′,3′ cyclic phosphate at the 7S pre-rRNA and a hydroxyl group at the 5′ end of the 26S pre-rRNA. Subsequently, GRC3, phosphorylates 26S pre-rRNA at its free 5′-OH group, allowing the associated RAT1 5′ to 3′ exonuclease and its co-factor RAI1 to trim 26S pre-rRNA to 25′S pre-rRNA.

Mediates the deneddylation of the cullin cul-3 (Q17391), which leads to the targeting of mei-3/katanin (P34808) for degradation at the meiosis to mitosis transition.

CPX-34	ANPR-A receptor complex	Dimeric receptor complex expressed in the atrium. Binding of the ligand AMP in response to atrial distension (high blood volume) plays a major role in the regulation of blood pressure and salt-fluid volume homeostasis. Binding of ANP to ANPR-A dimer activates the receptor and stimulates its guanylate cyclase activity, thereby elevating intracellular cGMP levels. cGMP, in return mediates the hormonal actions through cGMP-regulated ion channels, protein kinases and phosphodiesterases.

CPX-345	Cyclin L2-CDK11B(p58) complex	Cyclin-dependent protein kinase complex. Appears to be involved in early events in the establishment of the centromere protection machinery and is required for centrosome maturation and centriole duplication, including sister chromatid cohesion. Also plays a role in apoptosis, apparently by phosphorylating and down-regulating members of the BCL-2 family of proteins. The p58 isoform of CDK11B is expressed during G2 and M phases, upon activation of an internal ribosome entry site present in the CDK11 mRNA.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606

CPX-3461	Chromosomal passenger complex	Serine/threonine kinase complex which ensures chromosome bi-orientation on the mitotic spindle during metaphase by phosphorylating multiple kinetochore components. It destabilizes monopolar attachments by phosphorylating key proteins at the kinetophore. The opposing Chromosomal Passenger complex and gsp-1 (Q27497) activities ensure that chromosomes achieve a bipolar attachment to the spindle. Monopolar attachments do not produce tension across sister kinetochores (and the complex may act by sensing this absence of tension). The Chromosome passenger complex is conserved from yeast to man and is an essential regulator of diverse aspects of mitosis that ensure faithful chromosome segregation. The complex undergoes changes in its localization throughout mitosis: in early mitosis it presumably localizes to chromosome arms while later in metaphase it is found at the centromere. At anaphase onset it re-localizes to mitotic spindle microtubules accumulating in the midbody in late anaphase where it promotes spindle disassembly and cytokinesis. It also plays a role in contractile ring formation and regulation of abscission in cytokinesis. air-2 (O01427), bir-1 (G5EFA2), and icp-1 (G5EE37) require csc-1 (O45952) to localize to meiotic chromatin, mitotic chromosomes and the spindle mid zone in meiosis and mitosis. In turn, bir-1 (G5EFA2), csc-1 (O45952) and icp-1 (G5EE37) localization to chromosomes is mutually interdependent.	ABI|Aurora B kinase complex|Aurora kinase complex|CPC		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:6239
CPX-3462	CLA4-BEM1-CDC24 polarity complex	Required for the establishment of cell polarity during the cell division cycle, and essential for bud emergence. Binds directly to activated CDC42 GTPase and is required for orchestrating a cellular gradient of CDC42. The complex assembles in late G1 and BEM1 directly augments the guanine exchange factor (GEF) activity of CDC24, promoting the exchange of CDC42-bound GDP with GTP. BEM1 also increases CDC24 phosphorylation by CLA4. Phosphorylation inhibits scaffold-dependent stimulation of CDC24 GEF activity, thus BEM1 stimulates GEF activity in a reversible fashion, controlling the flux of cellular signalling through CDC42. The core circuit appears to be a positive feedback loop with GTP-CDC42 at the membrane recruiting the complex from the cytoplasm to promote activation of neighbouring CDC42. A corresponding negative feedback loop appears to ensure only one bud forms.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:559292
CPX-3463	Central spindlin complex	Microtubule-dependent and Rho-mediated signaling complex. Plays a key role in the formation of the central spindle (a set of microtubule bundles that forms between the separating chromosomes) during late anaphase and contractile ring formation during cytokinesis. During anaphase, activates and targets the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) ect-2 (Q9U364) to the central spindle, where it can activate the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Rho family member rho-1 (Q22038). rho-1 signalling is controlled by the central spindle. The complex promotes the formation of microtubule bundles acting cooperatively with several other protein complexes to bundle antiparallel microtubules during anaphase. Localization at the central spindle requires the Chromosome passenger complex (CPX-3461). Furthermore, the complex is directly phosphorylated by the Chromosome passenger complex. Phosphorylation of the complex regulates its activity during cytokinesis. The complex may also stimulate rho-1 activation at the cell membrane, which in turn orchestrates contractile ring assembly and constriction during cytokinesis.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:6239

CPX-35	ANPR-A receptor complex	Dimeric receptor complex expressed in the atrium. Binding of the ligand AMP in response to atrial distension (high blood volume) plays a major role in the regulation of blood pressure and salt-fluid volume homeostasis. Binding of atrial natriuretic peptide ANP to ANPR-A dimer activates the receptor and stimulates its guanylate cyclase activity, thereby elevating intracellular cGMP levels. cGMP, in return mediates the hormonal actions through cGMP-regulated ion channels, protein kinases and phosphodiesterases.

CPX-3521	myrf-1-myrf-2 complex	Plays a role in the synaptic rewiring of the GABAergic motor neurons (known as dorsal D (DD) neurons) during the early stages of larval development. The complex forms between full length proteins, both of which are subsequently processed in the endoplasmic reticulum and undergo serine-483-dependent auto-cleavage through the intramolecular chaperone auto-processing domain (IPR030392). This results in the translocation of the N-termini complex to the nucleus where it binds to DNA to regulate synaptic rewiring. The C-termini are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. Synaptic rewiring occurs during the L1 stage and is completed by the late L2 stage of larval development. Early in larval development, DD neurons form new processes onto dorsal muscles whilst the existing ventral synapses are disassembled. At the same time, new ventral motor neurons are generated and are incorporated into the motor circuitry.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:6239

CPX-358	ATG5-ATG12-TECPR1 complex	Essential for autophagy during nutrient deprivation, a catabolic process that sequesters undesired cellular material into autophagosomes for delivery to lysosomes for degradation. Once autophagosome formation is completed, the autophagosome docks lysosomes in order to degrade cellular cargoes by fusion. At this point, the surrounding acidic condition drives ATG5 to change its binding partner from ATG16L1 to TECPR1. Binding of the ATG12-ATG5 conjugate to a region of TECPR1 frees an auto-inhibition of the PH domain within this protein. This domain is then freed to attach to a phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate molecule of the autophagosomal membrane, thus tethering the autophagosome to a lysosome. These 2 vesicles will then undergo SNARE-mediated fusion to form an autolysosome.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606
CPX-3580	fiu outer membrane transporter complex	A member of the TonB-dependent transporter family (TBDTs) which binds and then transports ions (probably ferric) complexed to sideraphores across the outer membrane. Sideraphore transport requires an outer membrane receptor (fiu), which is relatively specific for its ligand. The ligand-bound receptor then physically interacts with the TonB protein. TBDTs are energy-dependent gated channels that usually transport large metal complexes which cannot fit through porins, and are too scarce to enter by mass-action-driven transport. Energy-dependent uptake through TBDTs requires interaction with tonB in complex with exbB and exbD in the inner membrane, ExbBD. TonB undergoes rapid energized movement driven by ExbBD which harvests the electrochemical force from the electrochemical proton gradient created by the proton gradient across the inner membrane and convert it into rotational motion. Hence, TonB may pull or twist the N-termini of TBDTs to promote transport of substrates into the periplasm. ATP-binding-cassette (ABC) transporters subsequently move the ion-siderophore through the periplasm and inner membrane.

Sideraphore transport requires an outer membrane receptor (yncD), which is relatively specific for its ligand. The ligand-bound receptor then physically interacts with the TonB protein. TBDTs are energy-dependent gated channels that usually transport large metal complexes which cannot fit through porins, and are too scarce to enter by mass-action-driven transport. Energy-dependent uptake through TBDTs requires interaction with TonB in complex with exbB and exbD in the inner membrane, ExbBD.

CPX-360	ATG5-ATG12-TECPR1 complex	Essential for autophagy during nutrient deprivation, a catabolic process that sequesters undesired cellular material into autophagosomes for delivery to lysosomes for degradation. Once autophagosome formation is completed, the autophagosome docks lysosomes in order to degrade cellular cargoes by fusion. At this point, the surrounding acidic condition drives Atg5 to change its binding partner from Atg16l1 to Tecpr1. Binding of the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate to a region of Tecpr1 frees an auto-inhibition of the PH domain within this protein. This domain is then freed to attach to a phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate molecule of the autophagosomal membrane, thus tethering the autophagosome to a lysosome.

CPX-362	Heparanase complex	An endo-beta-D-glucuronidase of the glycoside hydrolase 79 (GH79) family complex that cleaves the extracellular matrix heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) into HS side chains and core proteoglycans. Selectively cleaves the linkage between a glucuronic acid unit and an N-sulfo glucosamine unit of HSPGs carrying either a 3-O-sulfo, a 6-O-sulfo or a 2-O-sulfo group, but not linkages between a glucuronic acid unit and a 2-O-sulfated iduronic acid moiety. HS sulfation serves as a molecular signal that directs heparanase to cleave only certain glycan sites and acts as mechanistic handles by which the enzyme can prize open the substrate HS helix and more effectively access the trisaccharide cleavage site via heparanase-binding induced distortion of the substrate helix. Present in a variety of cellular locations where it performs an essential housekeeping role in catabolic processing of internalized HSPGs and at the cell surface or released into the ECM where it participates in ECM degradation and remodeling. HSPGs ensure that bioactive molecules such as growth factors, chemokines, lipoproteins, and enzymes are localized to the cell surface and ECM and function in the control of normal and pathological processes. These include morphogenesis, osteogenesis, hair follicle inner root sheath differentiation and hair homeostasis, wound healing, shedding of syndecans, inflammation, pre-eclampsia, autoimmunity, cell proliferation and migration associated with metastasis, endothelial invasion and angiogenesis. Cleavage of HSPGs is likely to release these regulators that can alter the functional state of tissues and provide a mechanism by which cells can respond rapidly to changes in the extracellular environment. The proliferative advantages conferred by heparanase lead to its up-regulation in tumors in a variety of tissues, and its over-expression correlates strongly with metastasis and worsened clinical prognoses. Also acts as pro-coagulant by increasing the generation of activation factor X in the presence of tissue factor and activation factor VII.

CPX-3742	cysEK cysteine synthase complex	Catalyzes the final steps in cysteine biosynthesis. The complex is comprised of the two enzymes that catalyze the final steps in cysteine biosynthesis. Serine acetyltransferase (CysE) catalyzes an acyl transfer from acetyl-CoA to L-Ser using a random-order kinetic mechanism to form O-acetyl-l-serine (OAS). OAS allosterically regulates CysB (P0A9F3), a transcriptional activator of the cysteine regulon, up-regulating CysB expression by binding to and preventing CysB from binding to its own promoter, where it inhibits transcription. OAS also regulates the balance of the bound and free forms of CysE and CysK by binding to and dissociating the complex. CysK a pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme, appears to be inactive in the complex, but when active, displaces the acetoxy group from OAS with bisulfide to yield L-Cys. Dissociation therefore stimulates both OAS consumption and cysteine synthesis.	CSC|SAT-OASS complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:83333

Poly-GlcNAc is required for the formation of an extracellular polymeric matrix produced when cells switch to growth in surface-associated multicellular communities or biofilms. The activity of the complex is allosterically regulated by the secondary messenger bis-(3'-5')-cyclic dimeric GMP (c‐di‐GMP) which binds to both proteins, stabilizing and activating the complex.	poly-beta-1,6-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine synthase complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:83333

CPX-376	Pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 heterotetramer	The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) catalyzes the overall conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and CO(2). Eukaryotic PDC is a highly organized multienzyme complex with the core structure formed by 60 subunits of dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (E2) and 12 monomers of dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase-binding protein (E3BP) to which other components of the complex are bound: 20-30 heterotetramers (alpha2beta2) of pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1), 6-12 homodimers of dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3), 1-2 homo (or hetero) dimers of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase and 2-3 heterodimers of phosphopyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase. E1 catalyzes the first irreversible and rate-limiting step in the PDC catalyzed reactions, i.e. the thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP)-dependent decarboxylation of pyruvic acid with formation of 2-a-hydroxyethylidene-TPP and carbon dioxide and reductive acetylation of lipoyl moieties of E2. Heterotetrameric E1 has two active sites that interact with each other during catalysis, each using TPP and magnesium ion as cofactors and each formed on the interface between the alpha and beta subunits.

CPX-3762	Apoptosome	A protease complex that cleaves loops in pro-Caspase-3 (P42574) and pro-Caspase-7 (P55210) in an ATP-dependent manner to create active caspases (CPX-970 and CPX-2862) that execute the death program. Its formation is triggered by the release of Cytochrome c (P99999) from the mitochondria in response to intrinsic cell death stimuli. When released, Cytochrome c binds to APAF1 in a 1:1 stoichiometry to trigger nucleotide exchange and stepwise assembly of a heptameric structure. Pro-Caspase-9 is then recruited to form a multimeric Apaf1-Cytochrome c - pro-Caspase-9 complex. Once recruited, pro-Caspase-9 undergoes auto-cleavage resulting in two subunits: p35 and a p10.

Eukaryotic PDC is a highly organized multienzyme complex with the core structure formed by 60 subunits of dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (E2) and 12 monomers of dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase-binding protein (E3BP) to which other components of the complex are bound: 20-30 heterotetramers (alpha2beta2) of pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1), 6-12 homodimers of dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3), 1-2 homo (or hetero) dimers of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase and 2-3 heterodimers of phosphopyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase. E1 catalyzes the first irreversible and rate-limiting step in the PDC catalyzed reactions, i.e. the thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP)-dependent decarboxylation of pyruvic acid with formation of 2-a-hydroxyethylidene-TPP and carbon dioxide and reductive acetylation of lipoyl moieties of E2. Heterotetrameric E1 has two active sites that interact with each other during catalysis, each using TPP and magnesium ion as cofactors and each formed on the interface between the alpha and beta subunits.

CPX-3785	Tryptase alpha/beta-1 complex	A trypsin-like serine protease predominantly found in mast cells from which it is secreted as a complex with proteoglycans upon its coupled activation-degranulation response. Active only after proteolytic removal of the pro-domain and functions both, as tetramer and monomer. Both forms are activated allosterically: The teramer is activated by insertion of the n-terminus of each protomer into its neighbour’s “activation pocket” while the monomer requires acidic conditions and heparin binding. While heparin binding in the tetramer is not required for its activity it both stabilizes the tetramer and allosterically conditions its active site. Substrates are diverse and include VIP, PAR2, pro-stromelysin, pro-urokinase, fibrinogen, cathelicidin, and kininogen. The active cleft of the tetramer faces towards the centre of the pore thus restricting accessibility for large substrates while the heparin-activated monomer processes large substrates like fibrinogen. Substrate catalysis leads to activation or inhibition of downstream biological pathways depending on context. Tryptase is an important mediator of the allergic inflammatory responses in asthma.

Under amino acid starvation conditions ULK1 and ATG13 are phosphorylated by mTorc1. Activated Ulk1 represses mTorc1 kinase activity via phosphorylation of Rptor(Q8K4Q0, subunit of mTORC1 complex) and phosphorylates ATG13, Rb1cc1 and itself. Under nutrient-rich conditions inhibited through phosphorylation of Atg13 and Ulk1 on Ser-757 by Rptor (subunit of mTORC1 complex), leading to cell proliferation and cell mass increase.

CPX-3802	30S small ribosomal subunit	Component of the ribosome, the site of protein biosynthesis resulting from translation of messenger RNA (mRNA). A ribosome is made two subunits - a smaller 30S subunit which binds to a larger subunit and the mRNA pattern, and a larger 50S subunit (CPX-3807) which binds to the tRNA, the amino acids, and the smaller subunit. When a ribosome finishes reading an mRNA molecule, these two subunits split apart. The 50S subunit acts as the decoding centre of the ribosome which brings mRNA and aminoacylated transfer (t)RNAs together, with the 16S ribosomal (r)RNA being required for the selection of the cognate tRNA. Guides the initiating start codon AUG of mRNA into position by recognizing the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, a complementary binding site about 8 base pairs upstream from the start codon. In order to form the translation complex with the 50S subunit, the 30S subunit must bind the Translation Initiation factor complex (CPX-2244), mRNA, and f-met-tRNA.	30S subunit		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:83333

Functions at a late step of autophagosome formation where it regulates the distribution of autophagy proteins such as atg-9 (Q3T903) and atg-13 (P34379). Within the complex itself, epg-6 binds to phosphatidylinositols on early autophagic structures to promote autophagosome formation. In particular, epg-6 binds with high affinity to phosphatidylinositols including phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P) and phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate (PtdIns(5)P), but more weakly to phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P) and phosphatidylinositol 3,5-biphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2).			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:6239

Its formation is triggered by the release of Cytochrome c (P62897) from the mitochondria in response to intrinsic cell death stimuli. When released, Cytochrome c binds to APAF1 in a 1:1 stoichiometry to trigger nucleotide exchange and stepwise assembly of a heptameric structure. Pro-Caspase-9 is then recruited to form a multimeric Apaf1-Cytochrome c - pro-Caspase-9 complex. Once recruited, pro-Caspase-9 undergoes auto-cleavage resulting in two subunits: p35 and a p10. This step leads to the formation of a proteolytically active Apoptosome.	Apaf-1 apoptosome|Apaf-1-caspase-9 complex|Holo-apoptosome		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:10090

Extracts LPS from the outer leaflet of the inner membrane and provides the energy to drive its transport across the inner membrane, periplasm and into the outer membrane through an ATPase-dependent mechanism. The cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding domain of the lptB dimer hydrolyzes ATP to switch the substrate cavity of the transmembrane domains of the lptF/G dimer between inward- and outward-facing conformations. LPS then crosses the periplasm along a continuous hydrophobic groove formed by lptC (P0ADV9), lptA (P0ADV1) and lptD (P31554).

The dosCP operon encodes two oxygen sensors that have antagonistic enzyme properties, with dosP being a heme-based c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase and dosC displaying diguanylate cyclase (DGC) activity in response to oxygen availability. dosC contains an N-terminal sensory globin domain that binds heme in an apolar binding pocket and catalyzes the synthesis of c-di-GMP via the condensation of 2 GTP molecules. Binding of O2 to the reduced heme in dosP enhances c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase activity, possibly die to a conformational change which releases catalytic suppression caused by the heme sensor domain.

Implicated in wide ranging cellular processes, including apoptosis, differentiation, DNA damage response, cell survival, regulation of ion channels or circadian rhythms, in response to steroid and thyroid hormones, calcium, fatty acids, TGF-beta as well as oxidative and genotoxic stresses. Dephosphorylates cdc-37-Ser14 within the complex. pph-5 resides in an autoinhibited state, in which its TPR domain interacts with the catalytic region and prevents substrate access to the catalytic pocket. Binding of pph-5 to daf-21/Hsp90 releases the autoinhibition of pph-5 to promote phosphatase activity of the complex.

CPX-3984	Hsp90-Cdc37 chaperone complex	A chaperone complex required for the proper folding, maturation and stabilization of target proteins (mostly signalling protein kinases, some steroid hormone receptors), usually during or immediately after completion of translation. Complex binding also prevents rapid ubiquitin-dependent proteosomal degradation of target proteins. The complex exhibits little ATP hydrolysis activity due to the binding of cdc-37 to daf-21/Hsp90, which inhibits the ATPase of daf-21/Hsp90. However, inhibition may be relieved by the binding of aha-1 to the complex; aha-1 eventually displaces cdc-37 from the complex. The highly conserved, phosphorylated cdc-37 Ser-14 is essential for complex assembly and binding to its target protein. cdc-37-Ser14 is phosphorylated by Casein kinase II/kin-3 (P18334), which in turn is a target of cdc-37 creating a positive feedback loop. cdc-37-Ser14 is de-phosphorylated by pph-5 (Q9NES8) within the serine/threonine phosphatase Hsp90-cdc-37-pph-5 complex (CPX-3983).

The hydrolysis of ATP enables the complex to cleave DNA 15–25 base pairs away from diverse blocks through endonuclease activity. Displays a preference for hairpin secondary structures in DNA which it cleaves close to the unpaired tip. SbcCD can also cleave 4-strand cruciforms and can open hairpin-capped ends. Cleaves at secondary structures formed by inverted repeats, or palindromic DNA sequences, producing double-strand breaks. The complex is also required to repair breaks made by restriction endonuclease activity and its exonuclease activity may process the ends of broken chromosomes. May bind and coordinate the two ends of broken DNA molecules to assist in their repair and may remove covalently attached or tightly bound proteins that interfere with end processing.

CPX-4022	ATP synthase complex	Acts to convert the energy of oxidation-reduction reactions of the electron transport chain (respiration) to the phosphorylation of ADP. The synthesis of ATP is coupled to the respiratory chain via the proton potential. The ATP synthase is a molecular motor composed of two separable parts: F1 and F0. The F0 motor spans the membrane converting the potential energy of the proton motive force (pmf) into rotation of the central stalk that in turn drives conformational changes in the F1 catalytic sites. Bacterial F-ATPase can also function in reverse, employing ATP hydrolysis to generate a proton gradient across the membrane when needed	F-ATPase complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:83333

CPX-403	RNA degradosome	Key role in mRNA degradation and RNA processing. RNA binds to RnaE, RhlB helicase is necessary to unwind the RNA secondary structures and, once unwound, the 3'-5' decay of the transcripts is ensued by phosphate-dependent PNPase. RNase E bound-enolase may connect cellular metabolic status with post-transcriptional gene regulation and link RNA degradation to glycolytic processes. A dynamic set of minor components of this complex may regulate its function and compartmentalization.	Degradosome|RNA degradosome|RNA degradosome - core component		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:83333
CPX-404	GABA-B receptor complex	G-protein-coupled, metabotropic transmembrane receptor for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate brain. Linked via G-proteins to potassium channels. Ligand binding causes a conformation change that triggers signaling via guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) and modulates the activity of down-stream effectors, such as adenylate cyclase. Signaling inhibits adenylate cyclase, stimulates phospholipase A2, activates potassium channels, inactivates voltage-dependent calcium-channels and modulates inositol phospholipid hydrolysis. Calcium is required for high affinity binding to GABA. Plays a critical role in the fine-tuning of inhibitory synaptic transmission. Pre-synaptic GABA receptor inhibits neurotransmitter release by down-regulating high-voltage activated calcium channels, whereas postsynaptic GABA receptor decreases neuronal excitability by activating a prominent inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) conductance that underlies the late inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. Not only implicated in synaptic inhibition but also in hippocampal long-term potentiation, slow wave sleep, muscle relaxation and antinociception.

Under conditions of stress the antitoxins are selectively degraded by cellular proteases such as Lon (P0A9M0) and ClpXP (CPX-3176), leaving the toxins to exert their effects which result in growth arrest and cell dormancy. Both the antitoxin and, in most cases, the TA complex bind the TA promoter to repress transcription, with TA complexes repressing transcription more efficiently than the antitoxins alone by increasing the co-operativity of antitoxin binding to operators.

Primarily acts in monocytes and macrophages. NLRP3 activation is triggered by two sequential signals. The basal level of NLRP3 in macrophages is quite low. Before activation, NLRP3 needs to be “primed” by Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Activation of TLR signaling not only transcriptionally up-regulates NLRP3 expression, but also post-transcriptionally activates NLRP3 by phosphorylation and deubiquitination. The second step, defined as “activation,” can be induced by several potent stimuli such as pore-forming toxins, leading to the oligomerization of NLRP3 and the subsequent assembly of inflammasome. Activating platform for Caspase-1 (CPX-952) through proximity-induced self-cleavage in an ATP-dependent reaction.

CPX-4241	NLRP3 inflammasome	A pro-inflammatory thiol protease complex that is activated by Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus and Group B Streptococcus, viruses such as influenza virus, pore-forming toxins such as hemolysin and pneumolysin, as well as by endogenous ligands and crystalline substances such as ATP, silica, and alum. Primarily acts in monocytes and macrophages. Nlrp3 activation is triggered by two sequential signals. The basal level of Nlrp3 in macrophages is quite low. Before activation, Nlrp3 needs to be “primed” by Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Activation of TLR signaling not only transcriptionally up-regulates Nlrp3 expression, but also post-transcriptionally activates Nlrp3 by phosphorylation and deubiquitination. The second step, defined as “activation,” can be induced by several potent stimuli such as pore-forming toxins, leading to the oligomerization of Nlrp3 and the subsequent assembly of inflammasome. Activating platform for Caspase-1 (CPX-4242) through proximity-induced self-cleavage in an ATP-dependent reaction. Activated Caspase-1 cleaves interleukins 1beta (Il1b, P10749) and Il18 (P70380) releasing the mature cytokines which are involved in a variety of inflammatory processes and is also involved in pyroptosis of macrophages, a special case of cell death, associated with infection by intracellular pathogens where it cleaves Gsdmdc1 (Q9D8T2). Activation of NLRP3 inflammasome is also required for Hmgb1 (P63158) secretion which stimulate inflammatory responses. It belongs to the family of Inflammasomes that includes NLRP1 inflammasome (CPX-4261, CPX-4266, CPX-4269, CPX-4270 and CPX-4271), NLRC4 inflammasome, AIM2 inflammasome (CPX-4243) and Pyrin inflammasome (CPX-4244).

Once activated, it has a strict requirement for an Asp residue at position P1 and preferred cleavage sequence of Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-|-. It cleaves interleukins 1beta (Il1b, P10749) and Il18 (P70380) between an Asp and an Ala, releasing the mature cytokines which are involved in a variety of inflammatory processes. Cleaves and activates sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs). Related to, but independent of, Il1b activation it is also involved in pyroptosis of macrophages, a special case of cell death, associated with infection by intracellular pathogens where it cleaves Gsdmdc1 (Q9D8T2). However, as a side effect of pyroptosis active Il1b is often released form the dead cells and therefore some link exists between both activities. While primarily a pro-inflammatory caspase it can also promote apoptosis in non-immune cells, especially in response to brain, kidney and renal cell injury. Caspase-1-deficient mice are protected from several acute and chronic inflammatory diseases, including sepsis and colitis.

Phosphorylation of CTNNB1 promotes its subsequent ubiquitination which targets the protein for degradation by the proteasome. Without WNT, Axin is also phosphorylated by GSK3, and thereby kept in an active (‘open’) conformation for beta-catenin binding and degradation.

CPX-4424	Reelin complex	Extracellular matrix, multifunctional signal glycoprotein complex that is secreted by Cajal-Retzius cells in marginal regions of the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus in the embryonic brain and by GABAergic interneurons in the adult brain. Binds to a variety of membrane receptors, such as the extracellular domains of lipoprotein receptors VLDLR (P98155) and LRP8 (APOER2, Q14114), both in a calcium-dependent manner, to Cadherin-related neuronal receptors (CNRs) or to alpha3beta1 integrin (CPX-1797). Receptor binding induces phosphorylation cascades, usually initiated by the phosphorylation of intracellular receptor adaptor protein DAB1 (O75553) or kinase LIMK1 (P53667). Also modulates phosphorylation of TAU (P10636). Eventually, Reelin induces receptor clustering, particularly of VLDLR, and internalization of a Reelin-receptor complex results in Reelin degradation. Reeling-induced signaling affects the dynamics of the actin and microtubular cytoskeleton as well as membrane trafficking through the regulation of the activity of small GTPases. It affects polarization, differentiation, neuronal migration and layer formation in the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus or the cerebellum of the embryonic brain as well as migration of sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the spinal cord, where it seems to act as a barrier to neuronal migration. Also affects neuron growth, maturation, and synaptic activity in the postnatal and adult brain. Abnormal Reelin expression in the brain can cause a range of neurologically-abnormal symptoms, including tremors, ataxia, lissencephaly, cerebellar hypoplasia and malformation of cellular layers throughout the brain and it is implicated in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression and Alzheimer's disease.

CPX-4474	Nuclear pore complex	The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a large assembly embedded in the nuclear envelope of eukaryotic cells. The NPC exclusively mediates all transport between cytoplasm and nucleus. A single NPC in a human cell can transport up to 80 MDa of material within 1 second. The nuclear basket subunits play an active role in transcription, transcriptional memory and chromatin organization by recruiting members of the transcription machinery to the nuclear side of the NCP.

CPX-448	Beta-catenin destruction core complex, Apc2-Axin1-Gsk3b variant	Phosphorylates cytoplasmic beta-catenin (Ctnnb1, Q02248) in the absence of WNT-signalling, thus positively controlling its continuous proteasome-mediated degradation. Csnk1a1 phosphorylates Ctnnb1 on Ser-45 and primes successive phosphorylation of Thr-41, Ser-37, and Ser-33 by GSK3. Phosphorylation of Ctnnb1 promotes its subsequent ubiquitination which targets the protein for degradation by the proteasome. Without Wnt, Axin is also phosphorylated by GSK3, and thereby kept in an active, open conformation for beta-catenin binding and degradation. Upon Wnt stimulation, the ternary Wnt-Fz-Lrp6 complex is formed and recruits the scaffold protein Dvl and the beta-catenin destruction complex. As a result, GSK3 is inhibited, Ctnnb1 is not ubiquitinated and accumulates in the nucleus, where it acts as a coactivator for transcription factors of the Tcf/Lef family, leading to activation of Wnt responsive genes.

Binds to a variety of membrane receptors, such as the extracellular domains of lipoprotein receptors Vldlr (P98156) and Lrp8 (APOER2, Q924X6), both in a calcium-dependent manner, to Cadherin-related neuronal receptors (CNRs) or to alpha3beta1 integrin (CPX-3117). Receptor binding induces phosphorylation cascades, usually initiated by the phosphorylation of intracellular receptor adaptor protein DabB1 (P97318) or kinase Limk1 (P53668). Also modulates phosphorylation of Tau (P10637). Eventually, Reelin induces receptor clustering, particularly of VLDLR, and internalization of a Reelin-receptor complex results in Reelin degradation. Reeling-induced signaling affects the dynamics of the actin and microtubular cytoskeleton as well as membrane trafficking through the regulation of the activity of small GTPases. It affects polarization, differentiation, neuronal migration and layer formation in the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus or the cerebellum of the embryonic brain as well as migration of sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the spinal cord, where it seems to act as a barrier to neuronal migration.

CPX-466	Tenascin-C complex	A matricellular glycoprotein complex of the extracellular matrix found in the basement membrane of many cell types.

Transcriptionally regulated by a large number of transcription factors, growth factors and cytokines as well as mechanical stress and negatively regulated by microRNAs (e.g. miR-335). Involved in the regulation of many embryogenesis and organogenesis pathways such as cell adhesion, cell migration, cell growth, gene expression of PDGFRA/PDGFRB (P16234/P09619) (through activation via Wnt/beta-catenin signalling pathway), epithelial morphogenesis and neuromuscular junction development.

CPX-4663	Osteoprotegerin complex	A soluble decoy receptor for osteoclastogenic cytokine TNFSF11/RANKL (O14788). Binding of osteoprotegerin to cytokine TNFSF11 prevents the cytokine from binding its receptor TNFRSF11A/RANK (Q9Y6Q6) and thus inhibits osteoclastogenesis. Bone homeostasis seems to depend on the local ratio between cytokine and decoy receptor. Osteoprotegerin may also play a role in preventing arterial calcification. Plays some as yet to-be-defined role in mammary gland physiology and hormone-driven epithelial proliferation during pregnancy and may act as a protective factor in bone microenvironment by preventing breast cancer-induced bone loss and reducing intra-osseous tumour growth. Also possible decoy receptor for pro-apoptotic cytokine TNFSF10/TRAIL (P50591) which competes with TNFSF11 and releases the inhibition of osteoclastogenesis. In vitro, binding affinity is 500x higher for TNFSF11 than TNFSF10.

CPX-467	eNoSc complex	A chromatin silencing complex that recruits histone-modifying enzymes and upregulates silencing of rDNA in response to glucose starvation. Upon glucose starvation, elevation of NAD+/NADP+ ratio activates SIRT1, leading to histone H3 deacetylation followed by dimethylation of H3 at Lys-9 (H3K9me2) by SUV39H1 and the formation of silent chromatin in the rDNA locus.

CPX-4701	BRCA1-BARD1 complex	A ligase complex that catalyses monoubiquitylation of heterologous substrates (especially core nucleosome histones) and Lys-6-linked polyubiquitylation of itself and coordinates a diverse range of cellular pathways such as DNA damage repair, ubiquitination and transcriptional regulation to maintain genomic stability. Unusually, autopolyubiquitylation activates its ubiquitin ligase function >20-fold rather than marking the protein for degredation. Plays a central role in the control of the cell cycle in response to DNA damage. Is a subcomplex of at least three mutually exclusive complexes: BRCA1-A (CPX-4702), BRCA1-B (CPX-4721) and BRCA1-C (CPX-4722).			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:10090

Transcriptionally regulated by a large number of transcription factors, growth factors and cytokines as well as mechanical stress and negatively regulated by microRNAs (e.g. miR-335). Involved in the regulation of many embryogenesis and organogenesis pathways such as cell adhesion, cell migration, cell growth, gene expression of Pdgfra and Pdgfrb (P26618/P05622) (through activation via Wnt/beta-catenin signalling pathway), epithelial morphogenesis and neuromuscular junction development. Only widely expressed in adult tissues upon inflammation in response to injury and also appears to play a role in peripheral nervous system axon regeneration. May act as a pro-oncogene.

CPX-472	DNA replication factor C complex	DNA-dependent ATPase that functions with PCNA (CPX-541) to confer processivity on DNA polymerase delta. RFC uses the energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis to recruit PCNA to DNA, break one clamp interface, and topologically link the clamp to primed template DNA during the duplication of chromosomal DNA prior to cell division. After loading PCNA, RFC then dissociates, allowing PCNA to function with Pol-delta RFC consists of five subunits in a spiral arrangement, each subunit being AAA+ family proteins, and the complex contains four ATP sites located at subunit interfaces. A cavity exists in the center of this protein spiral that accommodates double-stranded DNA. Conserved polar and positively charged residues line the cavity and interact with DNA. There is a gap between two subunits, RFC1 and RFC5, which may provide an exit path for single-stranded DNA from the central cavity.

CPX-473	TOM40 mitochondrial outer membrane translocase core complex	Core cation-selective high-conductance channel of the mitochondrial outer membrane preprotein translocase, through which nuclear-encoded precursor proteins cross the membrane in an unfolded state. Most mitochondrial proteins are synthesized in the cytosol, imported into mitochondria, sorted to one of the four submitochondrial compartments, where they function, and attain their functional native conformation, which is often facilitated by assembly into the membrane or a multiprotein complex. The existance of this core complex may be an artefact of the purification process but yeast cells lacking the receptor subunits (TOM20 and TOM70) are viable and import proteins at a reduced rate into the mitochondria.

CPX-474	TOM40 mitochondrial outer membrane translocase holocomplex	Translocase in the outer mitochondrial membrane that mediates the import of precursor protein and mediates inset of some resident outer membrane proteins. Most mitochondrial proteins are synthesized in the cytosol, imported into mitochondria, sorted to one of the four submitochondrial compartments, where they function, and attain their functional native conformation, which is often facilitated by assembly into the membrane or a multiprotein complex. The holo TOM complex contains two or three pores, each of which has a diameter of approximately 20A. When translocation by the TOM complex is coupled with that by the TIM23 or TIM22 complex, the TOM channel can operate as a passive pore to allow passage of the polypeptide segment, which is `pulled' by the TIM complex with the aid of differenial membrane potential and/or ATP. When translocation is uncoupled from the inner-membrane translocators, the TOM complex uses both the stop-transfer pathway, which consists of two steps, the first requiring a membrane potential and an ATP-dependent chaperone mHsp70, and a second mechanism involving the folding of an N-terminal domain that has already crossed the outer membrane and can function as a trap in the intermembrane space to drive translocation of the C-terminal part of the protein by a Brownian ratchet mechanism.

LAMTOR1 is directly responsible for anchoring the Ragulator complex to membranes. Also required for late endosomes/lysosomes biogenesis, it may regulate both the recycling of receptors through endosomes and the MAPK signaling pathway through recruitment of some of its components to late endosomes.

CPX-4743	Curli secretion complex	Secretion complex required for the production of Curli, a class of functional amyloid fibers that serve as protein scaffolds in the extracellular biofilm matrix. Unstructured CSGA (P28307), the major curli subunit, is transported into the periplasmic space by the SecYEG translocon (CPX-1096) and maintained in a soluble, secretion-competent state by CSGC prior to delivery to the outer membrane CSGG pore by the periplasmic accessory protein CSGE. CSGE assembles into a nonameric ring that caps the periplasmic vestibule of the CSGG pore. The GSGE-GSGG pore fully or partially entraps the 129-residue CSGA, leads to a decrease in its conformational space, creating an entropic potential favouring polypeptide folding and facilitating its entropy-driven diffusion across the outer membrane.

CPX-476	Nuclear exosome complex, DIS3-EXOSC10 variant	3' -5' exo- and endoribonuclease complex that is involved in RNA maturation and degradation which include the removal of unstable and aberrant transcripts and may also regulate the levels of specific transcripts in response to environmental factors. Restricted to processing linear and circular single-stranded RNAs only. RNAs with complex secondary structures, particularly at the 3' end of the molecule, may have to be unwound or pre-processed by co-factors prior to entering the complex. Although some RNAs may be targeted directly to the catalytic subunits, the majority of substrates enter the barrel-like structure of the exosome through a pore at the centre of the cap and are threaded through the central channel in a 3' to 5' orientation. The ribonuclease activity of the catalytic subunits facilitates the degradation process. A number of different exosome variants exist in the cell that are distinguished by the inclusion of their respective catalytic subunit(s): the main cytoplasmic exosome with DIS3L (CPX-592) or DIS3L and EXOSC10 (CPX-600), the main nuclear exosome with DIS3 and EXOSC10 (this complex), the nucleolar exosome with EXOSC10 (CPX-591) and a rare variant found in both, the nucleus and cytosol, (CPX-593). The nuclear RNA exosome is involved in a) proper maturation of most RNA species such as intron-removal from pre-mRNAs and tRNA precursors and rRNA, snRNA, snoRNA, lncRNA and enhancer RNA processing, especially the removal of their 3-prime ends, b) the elimination of RNA processing by-products and non-coding, cryptic transcripts, such as promoter-upstream transcripts (PROMPTs), enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), heterochromatin-forming repetitive elements (ribosomal DNA repeats and centromeres) and long non-coding RNAs, c) the elimination of mRNAs with processing defects and mRNAs that fail to undergo proper splicing or 3-prime end formation and d) gene expression either by mRNA processing or coordination of intron retention leading to regulation of decay of otherwise intact mRNAs. Nuclear exosome activity therefore limits or excludes export of target RNAs to the cytoplasm. Possibly involved in the degradation of mRNAs with defects in their co-transcriptional packaging into ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs), retention of aberrant transcripts on the chromatin, immunoglobulin (Ig) class switch recombination (CSR), Ig variable region somatic hypermutation (SHM) transcription termination or DNA damage repair processes. A small amount of this complex has also been found in the cytoplasm.	Nuclear exosome complex, RRP44-RRP6 variant		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606

CPX-4763	Osteoprotegerin complex	A soluble decoy receptor for osteoclastogenic cytokine Tnfsf11/Rankl (O35235). Binding of osteoprotegerin to cytokine Tnfsf11 prevents the cytokine from binding its receptor Tnfrsf11a/Rank (O35305) and thus inhibits osteoclastogenesis. Bone homeostasis seems to depend on the local ratio between cytokine and decoy receptor. Osteoprotegerin may also play a role in preventing arterial calcification. Plays some as yet to-be-defined role in mammary gland physiology and hormone-driven epithelial proliferation during pregnancy and may act as a protective factor in bone microenvironment by preventing breast cancer-induced bone loss and reducing intra-osseous tumour growth. Also possible decoy receptor for pro-apoptotic cytokine Tnfsf10/Trail (P50591) which competes with Tnfsf11 and releases the inhibition of osteoclastogenesis. In vitro, binding affinity is 500x higher for Tnfsf11 than Tnfsf10. Binding of osteoprotegerin to Tnfsf10 appears to contribute to tumour growth of breast cancer cells and progression at the primary tumour site.

CPX-4781	Citrate lyase complex	An anaerobic citrate lyase transferase that also catalyzes the cleavage of citrate to acetate and oxaloacetate. The citrate molecule is very stable, and needs to be activated prior to cleavage by forming a thioester bond with the enzyme. The enzyme is a complex of three subunits, one of them a dedicated acyl carrier protein which is synthesized in an apo form, and is converted to its holo form by the covalent binding of a prosthetic S-acetyl-O-[2'-(5-phosphoribosyl)-3'-dephospho-CoA]-L-serine(3-) group, resulting in the formation of an inactive citrate-lyase.

CPX-485	UBC13-UEV1A ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 complex	Implicated in the non-proteolytic regulation of signaling pathways by contributing to the addition of lysine 63-linked ubiquitin chains to proteins. Transfers the thioester-bound donor ubiquitin from UBE2N onto the UBE2V1 catalytically inactive E2 variant. The heterodimer, together with the RING ubiquitin ligase TRAF6, then catalyzes the formation of multiubiquitin chains linked by isopeptide bonds between Lys-63 and the C-terminus of the next monomer in the chain. This type of polyubiquitination does not lead to protein degradation by the proteasome but instead mediates activation of target genes by activating intracellular signaling cascades, in particular TRAF-dependent NF-kappa-B signaling.

CPX-4862	Alkyl hydroperoxide reductase complex	Serves as a primary hydroperoxide scavenger that reduces organic hydroperoxides and and peroxinitrite to water or alcohols, thereby preventing protein oxidation, lipid peroxidation and DNA damage. A conserved redox-active cysteine residue (Cys-47), the peroxidatic cysteine (C(P)), in the active site of one ahpC molecule is responsible for a nucleophilic attack on the peroxide substrate. The peroxide oxidizes the C(P)-SH to cysteine sulfenic acid (C(P)-SOH), which then reacts with another cysteine residue (Cys-166), the resolving cysteine (C(R)) located at the C-terminus of a second subunit of ahpC to form a disulfide bridge. Oxidized ahpC is regenerated by electron donation via the disulphide center (-CxxC-) in the N-terminal domain of ahpF, resulting in reduction of the ahpC cysteines to their thiol form using either NADH or NADPH as an electron donor.

CPX-487	uPA-uPAR complex	Regulates the activity of the plasminogen activation system, an extracellular proteolytic cascade. uPAR (PLAUR) localizes uPA (PLAU) and its zymogen form, pro-uPA, to the cell surface. Activated uPA cleaves the zymogen plasminogen (P00747), generating the protease plasmin. Plasmin cleaves a range of extra-cellular matrix components, is essential for fibrinolysis, the degradation and clearance of fibrin blood clots, and activates matrix metalloproteases, affecting a number of physiological and disease processes including tumor growth and metastasis, angiogenesis and inflammation. May also mediate the proteolysis-independent signal transduction activation effects of uPA. uPAR is subject to negative-feedback regulation by uPA which cleaves it into an inactive form.

CPX-4881	DNA-directed RNA polymerase holoenzyme complex, Sigma70 variant	Catalyzes the transcription of RNA from an DNA template by acting as a nucleotidyl transferase that polymerizes ribonucleotides at the 3-prime end of an RNA transcript. Five subunits, rpoA/alpha, rpoB/beta, rpoC/beta-prime and rpoZ/omega form the catalytic core. To initiate promoter specific DNA transcription, the core enzyme has to bind a sigma factor, which helps to direct the polymerase to specific promoters. rpoD/Sigma70 is the primary or housekeeping sigma factor which preferentially transcribes genes associated with fast growth such as ribosomal operons. rpoD is composed of four domains: region 1.1, regions 1.2-2.4, regions 3.0-3.2 and regions 4.1-4.2 which bind to promoter DNA as part of the holoenzyme; domains 2, 3 and 4 recognize the promoter DNA sequences of -10, extended -10, and -35, respectively.

Five subunits, rpoA/alpha, rpoB/beta, rpoC/beta-prime and rpoZ/omega form the catalytic core. To initiate promoter specific DNA transcription, the core enzyme has to bind a sigma factor, which helps to direct the polymerase to specific promoters. rpoS efficiently transcribes genes involved in stress responses (including include starvation, hyperosmolarity, pH downshift, or non-optimal high or low temperature) and secondary metabolism as well as RNAs from intergenic regions. In conditions such as nutrient starvation or oxidative stress, rpoS is believed to take over transcription of genes important for cell survival that are under rpoD control during faster growth. Genes under the control of rpoS are characterized by promoter sequences very similar to rpoD-dependent genes but differ in conservation of the upstream promoter element and of the -35 sequence, and in the sequence immediately upstream of the -10 promoter element.

Five subunits, rpoA/alpha, rpoB/beta, rpoC/beta-prime and rpoZ/omega form the catalytic core. To initiate promoter specific DNA transcription, the core enzyme has to bind a sigma factor, which helps to direct the polymerase to specific promoters. rpoN acts as a master switch to turn on genes involved in nitrogen assimilation, motility, host colonization, and biofilm formation. rpoN promoters additionally encode an insulator sequence to dampen unwanted translation, preventing accidental expression of rpoN-controlled genes arising from transcriptional read-through. This is due to the presence of loosely defined, short CT-rich motifs of 3-5 bp (CTmers), where the strength of silencing was dependent on the number and the position of the CTmers.

To initiate promoter specific DNA transcription, the core enzyme has to bind a sigma factor, which helps to direct the polymerase to specific promoters. rpoE transcribes genes involved in envelope stress response, responding to extracellular stress and the resulting disruption of proteins in the outer membrane or periplasm leading to an accumulation of misfolded and/or mis-translocated outer membrane proteins or lipopolysaccharide within the periplasm. Induces biofilm formation and appears to play a role in the virulence of some pathogenic strains.

CPX-493	Interleukin-7 sIL7RA-IL2RG receptor-ligand potentiating complex	Complex formed on the binding of extracellular interleukin-7 (IL7) to its receptor composed of a soluble form of IL7R (sIL7R) and the shared IL2RG. IL7 is expressed in lymphoid as well as in non-lymphoid sites, and is a key regulator of immune homeostasis. IL7 is critical for B cell development, and tonic IL7 signalling is essential for the proliferation and survival of memory and naive T cells, as well as T cell development in the thymus. A potent immunomodulator of tumours, it has both the ability to eradicate tumours but also exert strong pro-tumour effects. There are two major isoforms of IL7R, the membrane-bound IL7R (mIL-7R, p16871-1, CPX-9102) and an alternatively spliced sIL7R lacking the transmembrane region encoding exon 6 (p16871-4). sIL7R circulates at a high molar excess compared with IL7 in healthy humans and binds IL7 with moderate affinity to diminish the availability of free IL7. The competition diminishes STAT5 phosphorylation and therefore excessive signalling but increases overall bioavailability of the limited resource IL7. IL7 signalling contributes to autoimmunity and has been implicated as a cofactor in multiple sclerosis, autoimmune colitis autoimmune diabetes and lupus. Individuals with a predisposing IL7R genotype have increased rates of IL7R mRNA splicing resulting in elevated levels of sIL7R and are thought to be at increased risk of autoimmune disorders.

The coagulation pathway is terminated when fibrinogen is cleaved to fibrin which in turn polymerizes to produce a clot. Its zymogen form is activated by selective cleavage of Arg-|-Ala and Arg-|-Val bonds by limited proteolysis by factor XI (CPX-6205) to form active factor IXa. Factor VIIa-TF complex (CPX-2808) also contributes to its activation. Inhibited by antithrombin (SERPINC1, P01008). Defects in the coagulation pathway lead to hemophilia B or venous thrombosis.

Activated uPA cleaves the zymogen plasminogen, generating the protease plasmin. uPA and plasmin induces a potent negative feedback on cell adhesion through specific cleavage of the RGD motif in vitronectin. Cleavage of vitronectin by uPA requires concomitant binding of both uPA and vitronectin to uPAR.	AFT-urokinase receptor-vitronectin complex|uPA-uPAR-Vitronectin complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606
CPX-502	Beta-hexosaminidase A complex	Hydrolyses the terminal non-reducing N-acetyl-D-hexosamine residues, such as N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylgalactosamine, which are beta-linked to oligosaccharides, glycolipids, glycoproteins, and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Facilitates the degradation of GAGs in lysosomes of the central and peripheral nervous system. Member of the Family 20 glycoside hydrolases (glycosidase). Active on water-soluble and amphiphilic glycoconjugates such as sulfated GAG fragments, and the sulfated glycosphingolipid SM2 (CHEBI:90163). Only the heterodimeric complex HEX A is able to remove N-acetylgalactosamine from the ganglioside GM2 (CHEBI:60327), a molecule composed of a glycosphingolipid with a single sialic acids linked on the sugar chain found in high concentrations in neuronal cell plasma membranes. Works in association with the GM2A (P17900) which extracts single GM2 molecules from membranes and presents them in soluble form to the enzyme or hydrolyses sulphated, membrane-bound substrates. Intra-lysosomal accumulation of GM2 ganglioside leads to severely debilitating neurodegeneration associated with Tay-Sachs disease, Sandoff disease and AB variant.

The hypB GTPase has two nickel binding sites, one of which (the lower affinity site) is embedded in the GTPase motifs and metal binding to this site modulates GTP hydrolysis. On formation of the complex, nickel moves from the G-domain site of hypB to hypA and the complex then dissociates. hypA subsequently docks on the large subunit of the hydrogenase precursor protein to deliver the nickel ion.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:83333
CPX-506	Interleukin-5 receptor-ligand complex	Transmembrane complex formed on the binding of a dimeric, extracellular interleukin (IL-5) to its receptor, IL-5R, a Class I hematopoietin receptor. Ligand binding results in the assembly of the complete complex, inducing the transphosphorylation of JAK1/2 molecules as well as phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tails of the receptors. STAT1/5 monomers bind to the phosphorylated site of the receptor and are phosphorylated by JAK1/2. Phosphorylated STAT1/5 dissociate from the receptors, dimerize, and translocate into the nucleus where they induce the transcription of target genes. IL-5 is a powerful pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by T-helper type 2 cells, mast cells, eosinophils, and natural killer T-cells. Essential for the maturation of eosinophils in the bone marrow and their release into the blood.

CPX-508	RXRalpha-RARalpha retinoic acid receptor complex	Member of the nuclear receptor family of ligand-regulated transcription factor complexes controlling the expression of numerous genes with a role in cellular differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. The 9-cis retinoic acid receptor (retinoid X receptor, RXR) is an important member of the nuclear receptor family because it forms heterodimers with many other receptors, including the all-trans retinoic acid receptor (RAR). RAR and RXR transduce the retinoid signal into a variety of genetic responses, and their functions underlie the essential role played by retinoids in the development and homeostasis of vertebrates. In the absence of RAR agonist, the RXR-RAR heterodimer recruits the corepressor proteins NCoR or SMRT and associated factors such as histone deacetylases or DNA-methyl transferases that may lead to an inactive condensed chromatin structure, preventing transcription. RXRA-RARA is a non-permissive receptor that cannot be activated by an RXR agonist but only by an agonist of the dominant partner receptor, RARA. Upon RAR agonist binding, corepressors are released, and coactivator complexes such as histone acetyltransferases or histone arginine methyltransferases are recruited to activate transcription. The RXR-RAR heterodimer binds more efficiently to retinoic acid response elements (RAREs), composed typically of two direct repeats of a core hexameric motif, PuG [G/T] TCA, than do either of the homodimeric forms of RXR or RAR.

Cardiac PLN is a main determinant of muscle contraction and relaxation. In the unphosphorylated form PLN inhibits the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA), a membrane protein responsible for the pumping most of the calcium from the cytoplasm to the SR, thereby causing a relaxation of myofibrils.	cardiac PLB complex|cardiac PLN complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606
CPX-510	uPA-uPAR complex	Regulates the activity of the plasminogen activation system, an extracellular proteolytic cascade. uPAR (Plaur) localizes uPA (Plau) and its zymogen form, pro-uPA, to the cell surface. Activated uPA cleaves the zymogen plasminogen (P20918), generating the protease plasmin. Plasmin cleaves a range of extra-cellular matrix components, is essential for fibrinolysis, the degradation and clearance of fibrin blood clots, and activates matrix metalloproteases, affecting a number of physiological and disease processes including tumor growth and metastasis, angiogenesis and inflammation. May also mediates the proteolysis-independent signal transduction activation effects of uPA. uPAR is subject to negative-feedback regulation by uPA which cleaves it into an inactive form.

The coagulation pathway is terminated when fibrinogen is cleaved to fibrin which in turn polymerizes to produce a clot. Its zymogen form is activated by selective cleavage of Arg-|-Ala and Arg-|-Val bonds by limited proteolysis by factor XI (Q91Y47) to form active factor IXa. Factor VIIa-TF complex (CPX-279) also contributes to its activation.

CPX-511	MUS81-EME1 structure-specific endonuclease complex	Structure-specific endonuclease that plays an important role in rescuing stalled replication forks and resolving the mitotic recombination intermediates. The complex recognizes the branched DNA intermediates and typically cleaves 3-6 base pairs of the 5-prime regions of the junction crossover point. Preferentially cleaves four-way DNA junctions, such as nicked Holliday Junctions (nHJs), D-loops, 3-prime flap DNA substrates that contain an exposed 5-prime DNA strand end at or close to the junction crossover point and replication forks, via the “nick and counternick” mechanism. DNA binding induces conformational changes in the linkers connecting the nuclease and HhH2 domains of MUS81 and EME1, which transforms the complex from a compact to an open state. These changes unmask the hydrophobic wedge that separates pre‐ and post‐nick duplex and create the 5-prime end binding pocket facilitating the DNA substrate bending by the complex, ultimately placing the incision strand at the active site of MUS81.

The all-trans retinoic acid receptor (RARA) is an important member of the nuclear receptor family because it forms heterodimers with many other receptors, including 9-cis retinoic acid receptors (retinoid X receptor, RXRs). Like other NRs, RARA contains DNA-binding and ligand-binding domains (DBD, LBD). In the absence of agonist, the complex recruits the corepressor proteins NCoR or SMRT and associated factors such as histone deacetylases or DNA-methyl transferases that may lead to an inactive condensed chromatin structure, preventing transcription. Upon ligand binding, RARs undergo a conformational change that results in the release of corepressors and transcriptional coactivators, such as NCOA1, are recruited to the LBD which activates transcription.

CPX-526	uPA-uPAR-vitronectin complex	Links proteolytic degradation of the extracellular matrix to integrin-mediated adhesion. The formation of this complex results in altered cell adhesion, migration, survival and proliferation. Components of the plasminogen activation system including urokinase urokinase plasminogen uPA (PLAU) and its cell surface receptor uPAR (PLAUR) have been implicated in a wide variety of biological processes related to tissue homoeostasis. The high affinity binding of uPA regulates the binding of uPAR to matrix-embedded vitronectin. Activated uPA cleaves the zymogen plasminogen, generating the protease plasmin. uPA and plasmin induces a potent negative feedback on cell adhesion through specific cleavage of the RGD motif in vitronectin. Cleavage of vitronectin by uPA requires concomitant binding of both uPA and vitronectin to uPAR.	AFT-urokinase receptor-vitronectin complex|uPA-uPAR-Vitronectin complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:10090
CPX-5261	40S cytosolic small ribosomal subunit	Component of the ribosome, the site of protein biosynthesis resulting from translation of messenger RNA (mRNA).

Responsible for the catalytic activity of the ribosome, the peptidyltransferase activity required to catalyze peptide bond formation. The nascent polypeptides leave the ribosome through a tunnel in the large subunit and interact with protein factors that function in enzymatic processing, targeting, and the membrane insertion of nascent chains at the exit of the ribosomal tunnel.

CPX-527	Interleukin-1 beta ligand-membrane bound receptor type 1 complex	Complex formed on the binding of a pre-bound extracellular interleukin-1 beta (IL1B) and a membrane-bound form of its receptor, interleukin-1R1 (IL1R1) to its coreceptor, interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP). Recruitment of IL1RAP completes complex assembly and initiates activation of the NFKB signalling pathway. IL1R1 signalling is regulated by the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL1RA, P18510) which competes with IL1B for IL1R1 binding (CPX-9126). A member of the IL1 family of cytokines, IL1B is closely related to interleukin-1 alpha (IL1A, P01583) carrying out similar biological functions by binding to their shared receptor complex. Although both IL1A and IL1B function via the same IL1R1 to drive an inflammatory response, IL1A is thought to act as an alarmin which regulates local inflammation while IL1B acts as a master regulator of systemic inflammation. IL1B is an inducible cytokine produced mainly by blood myeloid cells, pathogenic lymphocytes and the central nervous system's (CNS) microglia and astroyctes during autoimmune, metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders. IL1B activity is regulated by two forms of the IL1R1: a membrane-bound form (mIL1R1, this complex) and a soluble form (sIL1R1, CPX-9128) created through proteolytic release of the ectodomain (ECD) of mIL1R1 via matrix metalloproteases. The ECD in both forms is vital for ligand recognition and binding. Both forms of IL1R1 are biologically active, mediating an inflammatory response through agonistic and antagonistic regulation of cytokine activity.

CPX-53	iNOS-S100A8/A9 complex	Stimulus-inducible, S-nitrosylase complex which S-nitrosylates cysteine residues in target proteins, a principal mechanism of nitric oxide (NO)-mediated signal transduction. S100A9 acts both as an adaptor linking NOS2 to its target via protein-protein interaction and as a transnitrosylase that transfers the nitric oxide moiety from NOS2 to its target, via its own S-nitrosylated Cys-3. S100A8 interacts with the target and dictates site-specificity of the S-nitrosylase complex by [I/L]-X-C-X2-[D/E] motif recognition. S100A8 binding induces a conformational change in the target protein and restricts transfer of NO from S100A9 to the motif-associated cysteine.

CPX-530	UBC13-MMS2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 complex	Implicated in the non-proteolytic regulation of signaling pathways by contributing to the addition of lysine 63-linked ubiquitin chains to proteins. Transfers the thioester-bound donor ubiquitin from UBE2N onto the UBE2V2 catalytically inactive E2 variant. The heterodimer, together with the RING ubiquitin ligase TRAF6, then catalyzes the formation of diubiquitin chains linked by isopeptide bonds between Lys-63 and the C-terminus of the next monomer in the chain. This type of ubiquitination does not lead to protein degradation by the proteasome but instead mediates error-free DNA repair and contributes to the survival of cells after DNA damage.

The mitochondrial ribosome (mitoribosome) is responsible for the synthesis of mitochondrial genome-encoded proteins, including at least some of the essential transmembrane subunits of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. All proteins synthesized by mouse mitoribosomes are hydrophobic, integral membrane proteins and some require prosthetic groups for folding and functioning. The mitoribosomes are tethered to the mitochondrial inner membrane and translation products are cotranslationally integrated into the membrane.

Final assembly and peptide binding take place within the peptide-loading complex (PLC), where the heterodimers undergo peptide editing. The complex seems to be required for the inhibition of the reduction of the disulfide bonds of the heavy chains and the assembly and stabilization of the PLC, suggesting Pdia3/ERp57 may play a structural role rather than a catalytic one.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:10090

CPX-5341	DBF20-MOB1 kinase complex	Probable role in exit from mitosis during the cell cycle. By parology to DBF2-MOB1 kinase complex (CPX-1683), the complex once activated, translocates to the nucleus where it phosphorylates an unknown protein to dislodge CDC14 (Q00684) from NET1 (P47035), resulting in diffusion of CDC14 throughout the nucleus. Phosphorylates CDC14 on several sites that flank the C-terminal nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequences, thereby inhibiting the NLS. Because of this, phosphorylated CDC14 molecules that escape to the cytoplasm cannot efficiently return to the nucleus and dephosphorylate substrates such as CDH1 (P53197) and SWI5 (P08153).

C3(H2O)Bb convertase is very unstable and readily inactivated by Factor H (P08603) thus regulating the amount of spontaneously available C3 convertase initiating the alternative pathway. Lack of protection, due to familial mutations in the complement genes or the presence of autoantibodies against regulators has been linked to atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and C3 glomerulopathies (C3G) in kidneys and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in eyes. Conditions of chronic and acute inflammations, as in rheumatoid arthritis, strokes, and heart attacks, become aggravated by complement activation against the disturbed tissue.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606

TIM50 interacts with incoming pre-sequence-carrying pre-proteins as they reach the trans site of the TOM40 complex (CPX-474). Pre-proteins are directed by the intermembrane space-exposed domains of TIM50, and TIM23 to the protein-conducting channel of the TIM23 complex. The pre-sequence translocase-associated motor (PAM) drives the completion of pre-protein translocation into the matrix. In most cases, the pre-sequence is proteolytically removed by the mitochondrial-processing peptidase (CPX-1630).

CPX-54	SMAD1-SMAD4 complex 	A transcription factor complex which binds to the promoters of target genes and recruits co-activators and histone acetyltransferases, such as p300, CBP and P300/CBP-associated factor, facilitating transcription. In response to TGF-beta/activin-family protein binding, primarily BMP (bone morphogenetic proteins), TGF-beta type II receptors phosphorylate TGF-beta type I receptors (ALK1, 2, 3 and 6) which in turn phosphorylates SMAD1 on Ser-463 and Ser-465. This enables binding to SMAD4 to form heteromeric SMAD complexes that enter the nucleus to initiate gene transcription. Because of their relatively low DNA-binding affinity, SMAD complexes interact with a wide variety of DNA-binding proteins. Crosstalk with other signalling pathways and interaction with other DNA-binding cofactors define the specific binding patterns of SMADs; in addition, interaction with coactivators/corepressors modulates their transcriptional activity.

Tethering of Tim21 to Tom22 may allow the preprotein to be released from the TOM complex and engage with the Tim23 channel. Tim21 also promotes dissociation of the motor PAM from the TIM23 complex, a PAM-free TIM23 complex promotes inner membrane sorting of of cleavable preproteins with a hydrophobic sorting signal.

Repair is initiated by the binding of mutS to a mismatch or to a small insertion-deletion loop. Assembly of the rotation-coupled diffusion-mediated MutHLS complex leads to activation of the mutH endonuclease which can cleave either side of the mismatch and increases mutH interactions with the mismatched DNA by at least 1000-fold, dramatically enhancing its GATC incision activity.

CPX-560	Mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III	Key role in aerobic respiration, in which mitochondrial enzymes accept electrons from electron carriers reduced in glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase pumps protons into the intermembrane space, creating an electrochemical gradient. This is achieved by oxidizing ubiquinol (ubihydroquinone) which reacts from the membrane phase, reducing cytochrome c in the intermembrane space, and using the free energy change to transport H+ ions across the membrane from the matrix to the inter membrane space. Quinol oxidation occurs in a bifurcated reaction, in which one electron is transferred to a high potential chain and the other to a low potential chain. The high potential chain, consisting of the iron sulfur protein, cyt c1 and cyt c2, transfers the first electron from quinol to an acceptor (cytochrome oxidase). The low potential chain consists of two cyt b hemes, which serve as a pathway through which electrons are transferred across the coupling membrane.

CPX-5628	Type I restriction-modification EcoKI complex	Defense mechanisms against foreign DNA introduced by an infectious agent (such as a bacteriophage). Comprises of two enzymatic activities: a restriction endonuclease (REase) and a methyltransferase (MTase). The REase recognizes and cleaves foreign DNA sequences at specific sites, cleaving endonucleolytically at phosphodiester bonds to generate 5′ or 3′ overhangs or blunt ends while the MTase activity ensures discrimination between self and non-self DNA, by transferring methyl groups to the same specific DNA sequence within the host's genome. The complex binds to a bipartite, asymmetric DNA sequence, 5'-AACN6GTGC-3', the MTase transfers the methyl group from S-adenosyl methionine to the C-5 carbon or the N4 amino group of cytosine or to the N6 amino group of adenine on newly replicated, hemimethylated host DNA and switches to an endonuclease activity on unmethylated foreign DNA, cleaving from approximately 100 base pairs to tens of thousands of base pairs away from the target. The latter reaction requires massive ATP hydrolysis to drive translocation of up to 50 kb of DNA at rates of up to 1 kb per second. The DNA is then cleaved at a random sequence remote from the original specificity sequence, with the generation of variable length single-strand overhangs Type-I DNA restriction-modification (R/M) systems are important agents in limiting the transmission of mobile genetic elements responsible for spreading bacterial resistance to antibiotics.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:83333

CPX-563	Mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III	Key role in aerobic respiration, in which mitochondrial enzymes accept electrons from electron carriers reduced in glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle.

This is achieved by oxidizing ubiquinol (ubihydroquinone) which reacts from the membrane phase, reducing cytochrome c in the intermembrane space, and using the free energy change to transport H+ ions across the membrane from the matrix to the inter membrane space. Quinol oxidation occurs in a bifurcated reaction, in which one electron is transferred to a high potential chain and the other to a low potential chain. The high potential chain, consisting of the iron sulfur protein, cyt c1 and cyt c2, transfers the first electron from quinol to an acceptor (cytochrome oxidase). The low potential chain consists of two cyt b hemes, which serve as a pathway through which electrons are transferred across the coupling membrane.

Cell entry via binding of Spike to the ACE2 receptor (CPX-5683) relies on two proteolytic cleavage events facilitated by host proteases, such as furin (P09958) and TMPRSS2 (O15393): the first cleavage occurs at the S1/S2 site, the second at the S2' site. Cleavage at the S1/S2 site can occur prior to exit from an infected cell or once bound to ACE2 on the surface of a new host cell. Cleavage at the S2' site occurs only on the surface of the new host cell. While furin is active in the Golgi and on the plasma membrane and can cleave Spike at both cleavage sites, TMPRSS2 only facilitates S2' cleavage on the plasma membrane. While cleaved Spike greatly enhances viral entry into the host cell, it is not strictly required for infection and not all Spike complexes on the viral surface are cleaved (CPX-7042). Alternatively, virions can enter the cell via the endosomal pathway and the use of an alternative protease, e.g. cathepsin L (P07711). Some variants of Spike carry mutations in the furin cleavage site that increases the proportion of cleaved Spike complexes which is linked to a higher infectivity of these variants.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:2697049

CPX-5687	SARS-CoV-2 NSP9 complex	RNA binding complex of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. It has been speculated that nsp9 dimers bind to single-stranded nascent and template strands as they emerge from the channel of the nsp7-nsp8 primase complex (CPX-5690) at a time when stable secondary structures have not yet formed, protecting ssRNAs from ribonucleolytic cleavage.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:2697049

Binds modified histones H3 and H4 and deposits them as a tetramer, preferentially onto replicating DNA, in a step coupled to the replication process. This is followed by deposition of a pair of dimers of histones H2A and H2B mediated by other factor(s) in a process not necessarily coupled to DNA replication. CAF-1 facilitates right-handed DNA wrapping of H3-H4 tetramers. The histone core of nucleosomes consists of two copies of each of histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4. CAF-1 nucleosome deposition is thought to be involved in heterochromatic silencing. CAF-1 is essential for S-phase progression in mammalian cells.

Potentially acts by inducing rearrangement of the host membranes to form double-membrane vesicles which may form a framework for viral genome replication by localizing and concentrating the necessary factors and possibly providing protection from host cell defenses. The multi-spanning transmembrane domains in nsp3, nsp4 and nsp6 may serve as a scaffold for the assembly of the membrane-associated replication/transcription complex (RTC), a large multisubunit assembly that is comprised of more than a dozen proteins.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:2697049
CPX-5692	SARS-CoV-2 3'-5' exoribonuclease proof-reading complex	The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus 3'-5' exoribonuclease complex which strictly targets double-stranded RNA and can selectively remove a mismatched ribonucleotide at the 3'-end of a dsRNA substrate. Formation of the NSP10-NSP14 complex strongly enhances the exonuclease activity of the bifunctional NSP14 and enhances the fidelity of RNA synthesis by correcting nucleotide incorporation errors made by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. May bind to, and act with the nsp7/nsp8/nsp12 polymerase complex (CPX-5742). Proof-reading exonuclease activity may explain why coronaviruses have the largest RNA genomes known to date. Complex formation does not appear to effect the C-terminal N7-methyltransferase activity of NSP14 involved in RNA cap modification.	SARS-CoV-2 NSP14/NSP10 complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:2697049
CPX-5694	SARS-CoV cleaved Spike protein complex	Spike protein complex of the SARS-CoV coronavirus that binds to human receptor ACE2 (Q9BYF1) and CLEC4M/DC-SIGNR (Q9H2X3). Cell entry via binding of Spike to the ACE2 receptor (CPX-5695) relies on two proteolytic cleavage events facilitated by host proteases, such as furin (P09958) and TMPRSS2 (O15393): the first cleavage occurs at the S1/S2 site, the second at the S2' site. Cleavage at the S1/S2 site can occur prior to exit from an infected cell or once bound to ACE2 on the surface of a new host cell. Cleavage at the S2' site occurs only on the surface of the new host cell. While furin is active in the Golgi and on the plasma membrane and can cleave Spike at both cleavage sites, TMPRSS2 only facilitates S2' cleavage on the plasma membrane. While cleaved Spike greatly enhances viral entry into the host cell, it is not strictly required for infection and not all Spike complexes on the viral surface are cleaved. Contrary to the activity of Spike in related SARS-CoV-2 (CPX-5682), owing to a different furin cleavage site, cleavage and activation of SARS-CoV Spike by furin and TMPRSS2 is less efficient. It is therefore thought that SARS-CoV virions may rely more heavily on the less efficient cell entry process via endosomes and the use of an alternative protease, e.g. cathepsin L (P07711).			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:694009

CPX-5698	AMPK complex, alpha1-beta1-gamma1 variant	Energy sensor serine/threonine kinase that plays a key role in regulating cellular energy metabolism. Energy stress manifests as a drop in the ratio of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to AMP/ADP, which activates AMPK's kinase activity, allowing it to upregulate ATP-generating catabolic pathways and to reduce energy-consuming catabolic pathways and cellular programs: inhibits protein, carbohydrate and lipid biosynthesis, as well as cell growth and proliferation. AMPK acts via direct phosphorylation of metabolic enzymes, and by longer-term effects via phosphorylation of transcription regulators.

CPX-57	Sodium:potassium-exchanging ATPase complex, FXYD2 variant	An ATPase-dependent transmembrane transport complex capable of generating electrochemical gradients by exchanging three intracellular sodium ions for two extracellular potassium ions during each cycle of ATP hydrolysis. Na+/K+ pumps can also generate an inward current of protons. Each transport cycle comprises a sequence of conformational transitions that permit extracellular K+ ions to access the binding sites in phosphorylated pumps and cytoplasmic Na+ ions to access the sites after dephosphorylation . Binding of the third Na+ ion triggers autophosphorylation, and binding of the second K+ ion prompts auto-dephosphorylation. This coupling of alternating ion access to ATP hydrolysis ensures forward, energetically uphill, progress of the Na+/K+ transport cycle. The larger pumped Na+ efflux than K+ influx constitutes outward current, a direction tending to make the membrane potential more negative. However, because each step in the cycle is reversible , if the normally transported intracellular Na+ and extracellular K+ are both scarce, the cycle can run backward, thus synthesizing ATP and generating inward, depolarizing current.

CPX-5766	MERS-CoV cleaved Spike protein complex	Spike protein complex of the MERS coronavirus that binds to human receptor DPP4 (P27487). Cell entry via binding of Spike to the DPP4 receptor (CPX-5768) relies on two proteolytic cleavage events facilitated by host proteases, such as furin (P09958) and TMPRSS2 (O15393): the first cleavage occurs at the S1/S2 site, the second at the S2' site. Cleavage at the S1/S2 site can occur prior to exit from an infected cell or once bound to DPP4 on the surface of a new host cell. Cleavage at the S2' site occurs only on the surface of the new host cell. While furin is active in the Golgi and on the plasma membrane and can cleave Spike at both cleavage sites, TMPRSS2 only facilitates S2' cleavage on the plasma membrane. While cleaved Spike greatly enhances viral entry into the host cell, it is not strictly required for infection and not all Spike complexes on the viral surface are cleaved. Alternatively, virions can enter the cell via the endosomal pathway and the use of an alternative protease, e.g. cathepsin L (P07711). Some variants of Spike carry mutations in the furin cleavage site that increases the proportion of cleaved Spike complexes which is linked to a higher infectivity of these variants.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:1263720

CPX-5770	MERS-CoV nucleocapsid complex	Forms the helical ribonucleocapsid (RNP) of the SARS-CoV coronavirus. Packages the positive strand viral genome RNA and plays a fundamental role during virion assembly through its interactions with the viral genome and membrane protein M (K9N7A1). Recognises and binds to a packaging signal, a cis-regulatory element encoded within the viral RNA. Plays an important role in enhancing the efficiency of subgenomic viral RNA transcription as well as viral replication. May form viral-like particles (VLPs) together with proteins M, E (K9N5R3) and S (K9N5Q8) without the requirement of genomic RNA (by similarity from SARS-CoV, CPX-5720). By analogy from SARS-CoV-2 (CPX-5686), may inhibit type I interferon (IFN-beta) activation and downstream innate immune responses.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:1263720
CPX-5772	MERS-CoV NSP3-NSP4 complex	Complex of the MERS coronavirus involved in inducing rearrangement of the host membranes to form double-membrane vesicles which may form a framework for viral genome replication by localizing and concentrating the necessary factors and possibly providing protection from host cell defenses.

CPX-5778	MERS-CoV NSP9 complex	RNA binding complex of the MERS coronavirus. It has been speculated that nsp9 dimers bind to single-stranded nascent and template strands as they emerge from the channel of the nsp7-nsp8 primase complex (CPX-5746) at a time when stable secondary structures have not yet formed, protecting ssRNAs from ribonucleolytic cleavage.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:1263720
CPX-5779	MERS-CoV polymerase complex	RNA-directed 5'-3' RNA polymerase of the MERS coronavirus which consists of the main polymerase protein NSP12 and a stoichiometric variant of the primase complex (CPX-5746). Extends partially double-stranded RNA templates and is probably also required for transcription initiation, though the mechanism for this has yet to be determined. Complex formation enhances dsRNA binding of the individual protomers.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:1263720
CPX-578	Cyclin-dependent protein kinase-activating kinase complex	Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activation minimally depends on two events: binding to a cyclin and phosphorylation of a conserved Thr residue in the activation (T) loop. CAK activates the cyclin-associated kinases CDK1 (P06493), CDK2 (P24941), CDK4 (P11802) and CDK6 Q00534) by threonine phosphorylation, thus regulating cell cycle progression. CAK activity is itself regulated throughout the cell cycle by T-loop phosphorylation of CDK7 on Thr-170. Phosphorylation of Ser-164 during mitosis inactivates the enzyme. In the transcription cycle, CAK serine phosphorylates the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (POLR2A, P24928) and other proteins, as part of the general transcription factor TFIIH. Phosphorylation of POLR2A in complex with DNA promotes transcription initiation by triggering dissociation from DNA. CAK also phosphorylates CDK9 (P-TEFb, P50750), which releases POLR2A from the promoter and and enables elongation of the transcripts.

CPX-5780	lambdaN-dependent processive transcription antitermination complex	Enables lambdoid phages to switch from immediate-early to delayed-early gene expression during lytic growth, allowing the RNA polymerase (RNAP) enzyme to read through intrinsic and rho-dependent terminators. The lambdaN protein binds and reorganizes RNAP components, and repositions nusA on RNAP, thereby redirecting nascent RNA and sequestering the upstream branch of a terminator hairpin. Formation of this complex may also hinder RNA engagement of termination factor rho (P0AG30) and/or obstruct rho translocation on the transcript.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:83333
CPX-5781	gadE-rcsB DNA-binding transcription factor complex	Transcription factor complex regulated independently of rcsB phosphorylation status.

CPX-5782	Tol-Pal cell envelope complex	Required for the co-ordinated invagination of the envelope layers during cell fission, using proton motive force to establish transient trans-envelope connections at/near the septal ring to draw the outer membrane onto the invaginating proteoglycan and inner membrane layers. Ion potential over the inner membrane is converted by tolQ and R to drive a conformational change in tolA, extending it through meshes of newly split murein to reach for free pal in the outer membrane. On bindng a pal molecule, tolA snaps back, drawing pal inwards, and then disassociates, allowing pal to engage the proteoglycan layer. Also acts to transport colicins classified in group A (colicins A, E1 to E9, K, N, and cloacin DF13) from the outer membrane across the periplasm.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:83333
CPX-5783	MERS-CoV 3'-5' exoribonuclease proof-reading complex	The MERS coronavirus 3'-5' exoribonuclease complex which strictly targets double-stranded RNA and can also selectively remove a mismatched ribonucleotide at the 3'-end of a dsRNA substrate. Formation of the NSP10-NSP14 complex strongly enhances the exonuclease activity of the bifunctional NSP14 and enhances the fidelity of RNA synthesis by correcting nucleotide incorporation errors made by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. May bind to, and act with the nsp7/nsp8/nsp12 polymerase complex (CPX-5779). Proof-reading exonuclease activity may explain why coronaviruses have the largest RNA genomes known to date. Complex formation does not appear to effect the C-terminal N7-methyltransferase activity of NSP14 involved in RNA cap modification.	MERS-CoV NSP14/NSP10 complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:1263720

AMPK acts via direct phosphorylation of metabolic enzymes, and by longer-term effects via phosphorylation of transcription regulators. Only three AMPK complexes are present in skeletal muscle: alpha2-beta2-gamma3 (CPX-5840) which is activated during exercises; and alpha1-beta2-gamma1(CPX-5791) and alpha2-beta2-gamma1 (CPX-5790) predominant in resting conditions.

Requires divalent cations for catalysis, and monovalent cations for activation. Plays an essential role in the preservation of the quiescent and differentiated status of the hepatocyte. MAT I is present in lower amounts than MAT III and is probably predominantly responsible for S-adenosylmethionine biosynthesis under normal conditions. At high methionine concentrations, MAT III, the predominant liver form, switches to a higher specific activity conformation (hysteretic behaviour) and rapidly eliminates methionine excess.

CPX-580	mRNA capping enzyme complex	Catalyzes the first step in mRNA cap formation. Consists of two subunits: an RNA 5'-triphosphatase (RTPase) and GTP:mRNA guanylyltransferase (GTase). The GTase subunit (CEG1) binds to the phosphorylated carboxyl-terminal domain of the largest subunit (CTD-P) of RNA polymerase II, coupling capping with transcription. CEG1 bound to the CTD-P is inactive unless allosterically activated by interaction with the RTPase subunit (CET1). CET1 removes the gamma-phosphate from the 5' end of the RNA substrate to leave a diphosphate end. CEG1 subsequently transfers the GMP moiety of GTP to the 5' end of RNA via an enzyme-GMP covalent reaction intermediate to form the structure GpppN1-.mRNA.

During meiotic pachytene, recruited to the Synaptonemal complex (CPX-3388) in between homologous chromosome pairs, where it promotes the accumulation of pro-crossover proteins including the ZHP-3-ZHP-4 heterodimer (CPX-5802), at a designated crossover site along the recombination intermediate. Limits the number of crossover sites along a recombination intermediate by restricting the association of these pro-crossover proteins with other recombination sites during late prophase. Plays a role in chromosome remodeling following crossover formation to promote two successive rounds of chromosome segregation during meiosis.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:6239
CPX-5802	ZHP-3-ZHP-4 meiotic pro-crossover complex	Required for crossover formation and subsequent chromosome segregation during meiotic recombination.

This in turn faciliates crossover and the formation of chiasma in each meiotic nucleus at the late pachytene stage of meiosis.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:6239
CPX-581	Casein kinase II complex, CKA1-CKA2 variant	CK2 is involved in regulation of cell cycle progression, presumably through phosphorylation of target proteins. CK2 may also have role(s) in inhibiting apoptosis. Phosphorylates serine or threonine residues proximal to acidic amino acids (consensus Ser-Xaa-Xaa-Acidic where acidic residue may be Glu, Asp, pSer or pTYr). Thought to be a dual-specificity kinase in yeast, also able to phosphorylate tyrosine residues, although with less favourable kinetic parameters. ATP or GTP can serve as a phosphate donor. Disruption of CKA1 or CKA2 is not lethal, but disruption of both is synthetic lethal. CKA1 and CKA2 functional overlap is not complete, as yeast with temperature sensitive alleles of CKA1 or CKA2 display distinct phenotypes and different combinations of CKA subunits affect substrate specificity and sub-cellular localization. Disruption of CKB1 or CKB2 causes sensitivity to NaCl and LiCl. Disruption of both CKB1 and CKB2 is not synthetic lethal, although the regulatory subunits are responsible for the structural integrity of the holoenzyme. Much of CK2B is phosphorylated on autophosphorylation site and also in a cell cycle-dependent manner.

CPX-584	RXRalpha-RARalpha retinoic acid receptor complex	Member of the nuclear receptor family of ligand-regulated transcription factor complexes controlling the expression of numerous genes with a role in cellular differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. The 9-cis retinoic acid receptor (retinoid X receptor, RXR) is an important member of the nuclear receptor family because it forms heterodimers with many other receptors, including the all-trans retinoic acid receptor (RAR). RAR and RXR transduce the retinoid signal into a variety of genetic responses, and their functions underlie the essential role played by retinoids in the development and homeostasis of vertebrates. In the absence of RAR agonist, the RXR-RAR heterodimer recruits the corepressor proteins NCoR or SMRT and associated factors such as histone deacetylases or DNA-methyl transferases that may lead to an inactive condensed chromatin structure, preventing transcription. Rxra-Rara is a non-permissive receptor that cannot be activated by an RXR agonist but only by an agonist of the dominant partner receptor, Rara. Upon RAR agonist binding, corepressors are released, and coactivator complexes such as histone acetyltransferases or histone arginine methyltransferases are recruited to activate transcription. The RXR-RAR heterodimer binds more efficiently to retinoic acid response elements (RAREs), composed typically of two direct repeats of a core hexameric motif, PuG [G/T] TCA, than do either of the homodimeric forms of RXR or RAR.

DNA binding induces conformational changes in the linkers connecting the nuclease and HhH2 domains of Mus81 and Eme1, which transforms the complex from a compact to an open state. These changes unmask the hydrophobic wedge that separates pre‐ and post‐nick duplex and create the 5-prime end binding pocket facilitating the DNA substrate bending by the complex, ultimately placing the incision strand at the active site of Mus81.

CPX-588	Calcineurin complex variant 1	A Ca2+/calmodulin-regulated Ser/Thr protein phosphatase, highly conserved through evolution and a critical component of Ca2+-regulated signaling in a wide range of unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes. Calcineurin is a heterodimer containing a catalytic (A) subunit complexed with an essential regulatory (B) subunit. Calcineurin function requires interaction of both subunits. The catalytic subunit contains an active site dinuclear metal center. The regulatory subunit is tightly associated, myristoylated and binds Ca2+ via four Ca2+-binding EF-hand motifs. Two redundant genes, CNA1 and CNA2, encode the catalytic subunit and their expression is regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner. In the yeast, Ca2+ signaling mediated by calcineurin, is required for survival during environmental stress. One role of the phosphatase under these conditions is to activate gene expression through its regulation of the CRZ1 (P53968) transcription factor. Calcineurin controls many other physiological processes in yeast, including cell cycle progression, cation homeostasis, morphogenesis, establishment of cell polarity and regulation of cell wall biosynthesis. Cells deficient for calcineurin are unable to survive pheromone-induced G1 arrest. When mobilization of internal calcium stores occurs, the catalytic subunit is bound by Ca2+-calmodulin and the active site is freed by displacement of the autoinhibitory domain.

CPX-5885	Flagellar export complex	A type III protein export apparatus that transports the rod, hook and filament axial component proteins from the cytoplasm to the distal end of the growing flagellar structure. The transmembrane export gate (flhA, flhB, fliP, fliQ and fliR) acts as a proton-protein antiporter to couple an inward-directed proton translocation with an outward-directed protein export. fliH, fliI and fliJ form a cytoplasmic ATPase ring which hydrolyzes ATP to activate the export gate.

CPX-5892	PspBC inner membrane stress response complex	Stress-responsive regulatory switch, which responds to membrane stresses, such as the mislocalisation of proteins to the inner membrane. Stress-induced alteration in its properties appears to lead to recruitment of pspA (P0AFM6), enabling at least a partial release of pspA from pspF (P37344) in the pspAF transcription regulation complex (CPX-5745).

Requires divalent cations for catalysis, and monovalent cations for activation. Plays an essential role in the preservation of the quiescent and differentiated status of the hepatocyte. MAT I is present in lower amounts than MAT III and is probably predominantly responsible for S-adenosylmethionine biosynthesis under normal conditions. At high methionine concentrations, MAT III, the predominant liver form, switches to a higher specific activity conformation (hysteretic behaviour) and rapidly eliminates methionine excess (By similarity).

CPX-590	Calcineurin complex variant 2	A Ca2+/calmodulin-regulated Ser/Thr protein phosphatase, highly conserved through evolution and a critical component of Ca2+-regulated signaling in a wide range of unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes. Calcineurin is a heterodimer containing a catalytic (A) subunit complexed with an essential regulatory (B) subunit. Calcineurin function requires interaction of both subunits. The catalytic subunit contains an active site dinuclear metal center. The regulatory subunit is tightly associated, myristoylated and binds Ca2+ via four Ca2+-binding EF-hand motifs. Two redundant genes, CNA1 and CNA2, encode the catalytic subunit and their expression is regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner. In the yeast, Ca2+ signaling mediated by calcineurin, is required for survival during environmental stress. One role of the phosphatase under these conditions is to activate gene expression through its regulation of the CRZ1 (P53968) transcription factor. Calcineurin controls many other physiological processes in yeast, including cell cycle progression, cation homeostasis, morphogenesis, establishment of cell polarity and regulation of cell wall biosynthesis. Cells deficient for calcineurin are unable to survive pheromone-induced G1 arrest. When mobilization of internal calcium stores occurs, the catalytic subunit is bound by Ca2+-calmodulin and the active site is freed by displacement of the autoinhibitory domain.

This results in DNA strand breakage, inhibition of cell proliferation and cell death.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:83333
CPX-5908	CcdAB toxin-antitoxin complex	Type II toxin-antitoxin (TA) system formed by the toxin (ccdB), and the antitoxin (ccdA). TA systems act as effectors of dormancy and persistence, with the toxin causing growth arrest by interfering with a vital cellular process, such as transcription, translation or DNA replication, and the cognate antitoxin neutralizing the toxin activity during normal growth conditions. Formation of this complex dissociates the CcdB-poisoned gyrase complex (CPX-5906) in a process called rejuvenation. The CcdAB complex also acts as a repressor of the ccd operon.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:83333
CPX-5909	Replication restart primosome complex, priAC variant	Required for the restart of replication at sites of premature termination of DNA replication which leaves collapsed/abandoned replication forks that would otherwise create double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) on the next round of replication. Serves to reload the replicative helicase dnaB on sites far removed from the origin of replication in a DNA structure-dependent manner. priA binds single-stranded, double-stranded and forked DNA with high affinity. priC binds ssDNA, preferentially associating with replication forks that include at least 7 nucleotide gaps between the nascent leading strand and replication fork. The dnaB-dnaC complex (CPX-1934) is recruited to the primosome, possibly through direct contacts with dnaT and the dnaB is loaded from dnaB-dnaC onto ssDNA on the lagging strand template. Recruitment of dnaG allows RNA primer synthesis from which the polymerase III holoenzyme can synthesize a nascent lagging strand.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:83333
CPX-591	Nucleolar exosome complex, EXOSC10 variant	3'-5' exoribonuclease complex that is involved in RNA maturation and degradation which include the removal of unstable and aberrant transcripts and may also regulate the levels of specific transcripts in response to environmental factors. Restricted to processing linear and circular single-stranded RNAs only. RNAs with complex secondary structures, particularly at the 3' end of the molecule, may have to be unwound or pre-processed by co-factors prior to entering the complex. Although some RNAs may be targeted directly to the catalytic subunit, the majority of substrates enter the barrel-like structure of the exosome through a pore at the centre of the cap and are threaded through the central channel in a 3-prime to 5-prime orientation. The exoribonuclease activity of the catalytic subunit facilitates the degradation process. A number of different exosome variants exist in the cell that are distinguished by the inclusion of their respective catalytic subunit(s): the main cytoplasmic exosome with DIS3L (CPX-592) or DIS3L and EXOSC10 (CPX-600), the main nuclear exosome with DIS3 and EXOSC10 (CPX-476), the nucleolar exosome with EXOSC10 (this complex) and a rare variant found in both, the nucleus and cytosol, (CPX-593). The precise function of the nucleolar RNA exosome has not been determined but as it shares the EXOSC10 subunit with the nuclear exosome it is thought its functions are related.

CPX-5910	Replication restart primosome complex, priAB variant	Required for the restart of replication at sites of premature termination of DNA replication which leaves collapsed/abandoned replication forks that would otherwise create double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) on the next round of replication. Serves to reload the replicative helicase dnaB on sites far removed from the origin of replication in a DNA structure-dependent manner.The PriA-PriB variant appears to be the dominant restart mechanism in E.coli, with priA binding single-stranded, double-stranded and forked DNA with high affinity. PriB appears to be important for restart following DNA recombination. On binding, priA undergoes a conformational change, exposing the priB binding site. The priA:priB:DNA ternary interaction stabilizes priA on the DNA and enhances its helicase activity, facilitating unwinding of the nascent lagging strand if one is present. dnaT is recruited to the priA:priB:DNA ternary complex which leads to release of ssDNA by priB. The dnaB-dnaC complex (CPX-1934) is recruited to the primosome, possibly through direct contacts with dnaT and the dnaB is loaded from dnaB-dnaC onto ssDNA on the lagging strand template. Recruitment of dnaG allows RNA primer synthesis from which the polymerase III holoenzyme can synthesize a nascent lagging strand.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:83333

Serves to reload the replicative helicase dnaB on sites far removed from the origin of replication in a DNA structure-dependent manner. On replication forks lacking nascent leading and lagging strands priC is sufficient to load dnaB from the DnaB-DnaC complex (CPX-1934) in the absence of any other restart proteins but appears to require the rep helicase to create single-stranded DNA on the lagging strand for restart pathway progression or to remove nascent lagging strand DNA to enable priC-mediated loading of dnaB. Recruitment of dnaG allows RNA primer synthesis from which the polymerase III holoenzyme can synthesize a nascent lagging strand.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:83333

The cytoplasmic RNA exosome is involved in general mRNA turnover (esp of Polymerase III transcripts) and specifically degrades inherently unstable mRNAs containing AU-rich elements (AREs) within their 3-prime untranslated regions and cytoplasmic rRNAs that have undergone polyadenylation. Degrades mRNAs subject to RNA interference and is involved in the following mRNA decay pathways: mRNAs with premature termination codons (PTCs; the nonsense mediated decay (NMD) pathway), ones lacking termination codons altogether (the non-stop decay (NSD) pathway) and ones where ribosomes stall (the no-go decay (NGD) pathway).

Restricted to processing linear and circular single-stranded RNAs only. RNAs with complex secondary structures, particularly at the 3-prime end of the molecule, may have to be unwound or pre-processed by co-factors prior to entering the complex. Although some RNAs may be targeted directly to the catalytic subunit, the majority of substrates enter the barrel-like structure of the exosome through a pore at the centre of the cap and are threaded through the central channel in a 3-prime to 5-prime orientation. The ribonuclease activity of the catalytic subunit facilitates the degradation process. A number of different exosome variants exist in the cell that are distinguished by the inclusion of their respective catalytic subunit(s): the main cytoplasmic exosome with DIS3L (CPX-592) or DIS3L and EXOSC10 (CPX-600), the main nuclear exosome with DIS3 and EXOSC10 (CPX-476), the nucleolar exosome with EXOSC10 (CPX-591) and a rare variant found in both, the nucleus and cytosol, (this complex).

Restricted to processing linear and circular single-stranded RNAs only. RNAs with complex secondary structures, particularly at the 3-prime end of the molecule, may have to be unwound or pre-processed by co-factors prior to entering the complex.

The nuclear RNA exosome is involved in a) proper maturation of most RNA species such as intron-removal from pre-mRNAs and tRNA precursors and rRNA, snRNA, snoRNA, lncRNA and enhancer RNA processing, especially the removal of their 3-prime ends, b) the elimination of RNA processing by-products and non-coding, cryptic transcripts, such as upstream antisense RNA species (uaRNA), enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), heterochromatin-forming repetitive elements (ribosomal DNA repeats and centromeres) and long non-coding RNAs, c) the elimination of mRNAs with processing defects and mRNAs that fail to undergo proper splicing or 3-prime end formation and d) gene expression either by mRNA processing or coordination of intron retention leading to regulation of decay of otherwise intact mRNAs. Nuclear exosome activity therefore limits or excludes export of target RNAs to the cytoplasm. Possibly involved in the degradation of mRNAs with defects in their co-transcriptional packaging into ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs), retention of aberrant transcripts on the chromatin, immunoglobulin (Ig) class switch recombination (CSR), Ig variable region somatic hypermutation (SHM) transcription termination or DNA damage repair processes.

CPX-5961	Mitochondrial calcium uniporter complex, MICU1-MICU2 variant	Highly selective, inward-rectifying Ca2+ channel located on the inner mitochondrial membrane. The uniporter is quiescent in resting cellular conditions and becomes activated only when local Ca2+ levels rise above approximately 1 microM with the MCU tetramer forming a calcium-conducting pore. Ca2+ uptake is driven by the large negative inner mitochondrial membrane potential generated by proton pumping into the intermembrane space by the electron transport chain. The stoichiometric ratio of MICU1/MCU/SMDT1 can vary between tissues, resulting in a tissue-specific activity profile that matches metabolic requirements.

CPX-5965	Mitochondrial calcium uniporter complex, MICU1-MICU3 variant	Highly selective, inward-rectifying Ca2+ channel located on the inner mitochondrial membrane.

Ca2+ uptake is driven by the large negative inner mitochondrial membrane potential generated by proton pumping into the intermembrane space by the electron transport chain. The stoichiometric ratio of MICU1/MCU/SMDT1 can vary between tissues, resulting in a tissue-specific activity profile that matches metabolic requirements. Neuron-specific MICU3 lowers the threshold of Ca2+-driven MCU activation enabling axonal mitochondria to respond to small elevations in cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels.

CPX-5966	Mitochondrial calcium uniporter complex, MICUB variant	Highly selective, inward-rectifying Ca2+ channel located on the inner mitochondrial membrane. The uniporter is quiescent in resting cellular conditions and becomes activated only when local Ca2+ levels rise above approximately 1 microM with the MCU tetramer forming a calcium-conducting pore. Ca2+ uptake is driven by the large negative inner mitochondrial membrane potential generated by proton pumping into the intermembrane space by the electron transport chain. Under certain conditions MCUB integrates into the normal importer complex (CPX-5961/CPX-5963/CPX-5965), displacing at least some of the MCU and MCU-bound MICU1/MICU2/MICU3 subunits. This appears to be a stress-responsive mechanism to alter mtCU gating and limit cooperative activation of the channel. For example, MCUB is not normally present in the uniporter complex of the heart at baseline, but only after stress or ischemic injury, and thus limits mitochondrial Ca2+ overload during cardiac injury.

CPX-597	Calcineurin complex	A Ca2+/calmodulin-regulated Ser/Thr protein phosphatase, highly conserved through evolution and a critical component of Ca2+-regulated signaling in a wide range of unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes. Calcineurin is a heterodimer containing a catalytic (A) subunit complexed with an essential regulatory (B) subunit. Calcineurin function requires interaction of both subunits. The catalytic subunit contains an active site dinuclear metal center. The regulatory subunit is tightly associated, myristoylated and binds Ca2+ via four Ca2+-binding EF-hand motifs. The gene encoding calcineurin A in S. pombe, ppb1, is essential for mating and sporulation. ppb1 is transcriptionally regulated in a cell-cycle-dependent manner and is induced under conditions that promote mating. Deletion of the calcineurin A gene ppb1 in haploid S. pombe cells results in branched and multiply septate cells with defects in septal positioning, polarity, and cytokinesis. Overexpression of ppb1 in wild-type S. pombe generates elongated cells with occasional aberrant nuclear and spindle pole body positioning. Ca2+ signaling mediated by calcineurin, is required for survival during environmental stress. Calcineurin controls many other physiological processes, including cell cycle progression, cation homeostasis, morphogenesis, establishment of cell polarity and regulation of cell wall biosynthesis. When mobilization of internal calcium stores occurs, the catalytic subunit is bound by Ca2+-calmodulin and the active site is freed by displacement of the autoinhibitory domain.

CPX-599	Nuclear/nucleolar exosome complex, DIS3-RRP6 variant	3' to 5' exo- and endoribonuclease complex that is involved in RNA maturation and degradation which include the removal of unstable and aberrant transcripts and may also regulate the levels of specific transcripts in response to environmental factors. Restricted to processing linear and circular single-stranded RNAs only. RNAs with complex secondary structures, particularly at the 3' end of the molecule, may have to be unwound or pre-processed by co-factors prior to entering the complex. Although some RNAs may be targeted directly to the catalytic subunits, the majority of substrates enter the barrel-like structure of the exosome through a pore at the centre of the cap and are threaded through the central channel in a 3' to 5' orientation. The ribonuclease activity of the catalytic subunits facilitates the degradation process. Two different exosomes exist in yeast, one found in the nucleus and nucleolus (this complex), the other form is lacking the RRP6 subunit and is found in the cytosol (CPX-603). The nuclear/nucleolar RNA exosome is involved in a) proper maturation of most RNA species such as intron-removal from pre-mRNAs and tRNA precursors and rRNA, snRNA, snoRNA, lncRNA and enhancer RNA processing, especially the removal of their 3-prime ends, b) the elimination of RNA processing by-products and non-coding, cryptic transcripts, such as upstream antisense RNA species (uaRNA), enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), heterochromatin-forming repetitive elements (ribosomal DNA repeats and centromeres) and long non-coding RNAs, c) the elimination of mRNAs with processing defects and mRNAs that fail to undergo proper splicing or 3′ end formation and d) gene expression either by mRNA processing or coordination of intron retention leading to regulation of decay of otherwise intact mRNAs. Nuclear exosome activity therefore limits or excludes export of target RNAs to the cytoplasm. Possibly also involved in the degradation of mRNAs with defects in their co-transcriptional packaging into ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs), retention of aberrant transcripts on the chromatin and transcription termination or DNA damage repair processes.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:559292

A number of different exosome variants exist in the cell that are distinguished by the inclusion of their respective catalytic subunit(s): the main cytoplasmic exosome with DIS3L (CPX-592) or DIS3L and EXOSC10 (this complex), the main nuclear exosome with DIS3 and EXOSC10 (CPX-476), the nucleolar exosome with EXOSC10 (CPX-591) and a rare variant found in both, the nucleus and cytosol, (CPX-593). The cytoplasmic RNA exosome is involved in general mRNA turnover (esp of Polymerase III transcripts) and specifically degrades inherently unstable mRNAs containing AU-rich elements (AREs) within their 3' untranslated regions and cytoplasmic rRNAs that have undergone polyadenylation. Degrades mRNAs subject to RNA interference and is involved in the following mRNA decay pathways: mRNAs with prem-primature termination codons (PTCs; the nonsense mediated decay (NMD) pathway), ones lacking termination codons altogether (the non-stop decay (NSD) pathway) and ones where ribosomes stall (the no-go decay (NGD) pathway).

CPX-6026	YafNO toxin-antitoxin complex	Type II toxin-antitoxin (TA) system formed by the toxin (yafO), and the antitoxin (yafN). TA systems act as effectors of dormancy and persistence, with the toxin causing growth arrest by interfering with a vital cellular process, such as transcription, translation or DNA replication, and the cognate antitoxin neutralizing the toxin activity during normal growth conditions. Under conditions of stress the antitoxins are selectively degraded by cellular proteases such as Lon (P0A9M0) and ClpXP (CPX-3176), leaving the toxins to exert their effects which result in growth arrest and cell dormancy. Both the antitoxin and, in most cases, the TA complex bind the TA promoter to repress transcription, with TA complexes repressing transcription more efficiently than the antitoxins alone by increasing the co-operativity of antitoxin binding to operators.

Although some RNAs may be targeted directly to the catalytic subunit, the majority of substrates enter the barrel-like structure of the exosome through a pore at the centre of the cap and are threaded through the central channel in a 3-prime to 5-prime orientation. The ribonuclease activity of the catalytic subunit facilitates the degradation process. Two different exosomes exist in yeast, one found in the nucleus and nucleolus (CPX-599), the other form is lacking the RRP6 (Q12149) subunit and is found in the cytosol (this complex). The cytoplasmic RNA exosome is involved in general mRNA turnover (esp of Polymerase III transcripts) and specifically degrades inherently unstable mRNAs containing AU-rich elements (AREs) within their 3-prime untranslated regions and cytoplasmic rRNAs that have undergone polyadenylation.

CPX-609	Signal recognition particle	A conserved ribonucleoprotein particle, which includes in its structure a small cytoplasmic RNA (scRNA). In co-translational targeting of membrane and secretory proteins, SRP recognizes signal sequences as soon as they emerge from the ribosomal polypeptide exit tunnel and binds to the ribosome-nascent chain complex (RNC), leading to retardation of peptide elongation. The SRP-RNC complex is targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane by interaction with the SRP receptor (SR). After docking to the membrane, the RNC is transferred to the protein-conducting channel, the translocon, and protein synthesis continues. The SRP-SR complex dissociates from the ribosome and, as a result of GTP hydrolysis, SRP and SR dissociate from each other. The genes encoding scR1 and SRP54 are not essential for growth, although SRP-deficient cells grow poorly, suggesting that an alternative, SRP-independent targeting pathway(s) to the ER membrane exists.

CPX-6121	TOM40 mitochondrial outer membrane translocase complex	Translocase in the outer mitochondrial membrane that mediates the import of precursor protein and mediates inset of some resident outer membrane proteins.

When translocation is coupled with that by the TIM23 (CPX-6129) or TIM22 (CPX-6124) complex, the TOM channel can operate as a passive pore to allow passage of the polypeptide segment, which is `pulled' by the TIM complex with the aid of differential membrane potential and/or ATP. When translocation is uncoupled from the inner-membrane translocators, the TOM complex uses both the stop-transfer pathway, which consists of two steps, the first requiring a membrane potential and an ATP-dependent chaperone mHsp70, and a second mechanism involving the folding of an N-terminal domain that has already crossed the outer membrane and can function as a trap in the intermembrane space to drive translocation of the C-terminal part of the protein by a Brownian ratchet mechanism.

CPX-623	Interleukin-6-mIL6R-mIL6ST receptor-ligand classical signalling complex	Symmetrical 2:2:2 complex formed on the binding of interleukin-6 (IL6) to the IL6 specific alpha receptor (IL6R) and the signal transducing component, IL6ST (glycoprotein 130, gp130). IL6 binds to IL6R with low affinity but the IL6:IL6R dimer binds to IL6ST with high affinity resulting in trimer formation. A hexameric complex is formed upon the interaction between IL6 of one trimer and the D1 domain on site-3 of IL6ST of the other trimer. IL6R exists as soluble (sIL6R) and membrane bound mIL6R, and complex formation results in the induction of either a pro-inflammatory trans-signalling pathway (CPX-8967), or a classical anti-inflammatory signalling cascade (CPX-623, this complex) leading to protective and regenerative outcomes, respectively. Ligand-receptor assembly results in the formation of the complete complex, inducing the transphosphorylation of IL6ST-associated JAK1/2 and TYK2 molecules as well as phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tails of the IL6ST receptor. Phosphorylated STAT3 dissociates from the receptors, dimerize and translocate into the nucleus where they induce the transcription of IL6 target genes. IL6-induced trans- and classical signalling is indifferent in canonical intracellular JAK-STAT pathway, but trans-signalling is considered to be the more potent of the two. The ratio of mIL6R to IL6ST on a cell's surface decides how trans- and classical signalling are sensed by a cell. IL6 is a pleiotropic cytokine involved in regulating inflammatory responses as well as co-ordinating developmental, metabolic and neuronal processes. Plays an essential role in B-cell differentiation and modulation of acute-phase responses. Involved in lymphocyte and monocyte differentiation. Acts on B-cells, T-cells, hepatocytes, hematopoietic progenitor cells and cells of the CNS. Dysregulation of the IL6 signalling pathway and in particular JAK1/STAT3 activity is associated with diseases such as Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and various cancers. The IL6/JAK/STAT3 signalling pathway is aberrantly overactive in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions and in those with haematopoietic malignancies or solid tumours, and targeting components of the IL6/JAK/STAT3 pathway has been shown to inhibit growth of tumour cells and relieve immunosuppression in the tumour microenvironment.

CPX-6233	Mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, somatic variant	Mitochondrial matrix enzyme that converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and CO2. This provides a metabolic connection between glycolysis, whose end product is pyruvate, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, which starts with acetyl-CoA. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity is negatively regulated via phosphorylation of its PDHA1 subunit. In the reaction mediated by the PDH complex, pyruvate becomes covalently linked to the thiamine diphosphate (TPP) cofactor of E1 (PDHA1 and PDHB), creating 2-alpha-hydroxy-ethyl-TPP. The alpha-hydroxy group of 2-alpha-hydroxy-ethyl-TPP is subsequently oxidized, creating an acetyl group that becomes bound to the dihydrolipoyllysine group of E2 (DLAT). DLAT transfers this acetyl group to CoA to generate acetyl-CoA.	PDH complex|pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (lipoamide)		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606

Ligand binding results in the assembly of the complete complex, which induces signalling mediated principally through the IL4R chain and involves activation of the transcription factor, signal transducer and activator of transcription-6 (STAT6). Signalling via the type-2 receptor occurs upon IL4 binding to IL4R first and then recruiting IL13RA1 to form the signalling complex. IL4 binding to IL4RAinduces the phosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK2 associated with IL4R and TYK2 associated with IL13RA1, resulting in STAT6 phosphorylation and translocation to the nucleus and transcription of IL4-responsive genes. IL4 mediated signalling through the IL4 receptor generates immunity to helminthic infections and enables the inactivation of toxins. Expressed in neurons, IL4R plays a key role in modulating neuronal death through STAT6 activation during ischemic attacks. Stimulating microglial phagocytosis, IL4 enables efficient clearance of apoptotic neurons allowing for repair. Systemic administration of IL4 has been shown to reduce ischemic lesions and improves neurologic function after a stroke.	IL-4 receptor Type II complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606
CPX-6240	CL-LK-MASP2 lectin-protease complex	Calcium-dependent pattern-recognition receptor and serine protease complex of the lectin pathway (LP) of complement activation. Activates the LP by binding sugar moieties of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) displayed on microbes via the lectin COLEC10-COLEC11 subcomplex. Binds preferentially to high-mannose oligosaccharides with at least one terminal alpha-1,2-linked mannose epitope, l-fucose, galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylgalactosamine, fucosylated glycans and lipopolysaccharides. MASP2 protease is probably activated by cleavage by a MASP1 from a neighbouring CL-LK-MASP1 complex (CPX-6181) and in turn cleaves and activates complement precursors C4 (P0C0L4) and C2 (P06681) to form C3 convertase complexes C4b2a-A (CPX-5675) and C4b2a-B (CPX-6156).

CPX-6242	Mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, testis-specific variant	Mitochondrial matrix enzyme that converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and CO2. This provides a metabolic connection between glycolysis, whose end product is pyruvate, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, which starts with acetyl-CoA. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity is negatively regulated via phosphorylation of its PDHA2 subunit. In the reaction mediated by the PDH complex, pyruvate becomes covalently linked to the thiamine diphosphate (TPP) cofactor of E1 (PDHA2 and PDHB), creating 2-alpha-hydroxy-ethyl-TPP. The alpha-hydroxy group of 2-alpha-hydroxy-ethyl-TPP is subsequently oxidized, creating an acetyl group that becomes bound to the dihydrolipoyllysine group of E2 (DLAT). DLAT transfers this acetyl group to CoA to generate acetyl-CoA.	PDH complex|Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (lipoamide)		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606
CPX-6243	Mitochondrial processing peptidase complex	Metalloprotease which cleaves off the N-terminal presequence from nuclear encoded mitochondrial precursor proteins, such as the sequence that targets the proteins to the mitochondrial matrix. Common features for cleavage of the extension peptides by MPP are a proximal basic amino acid residue, usually arginine at the P2 position, distal N-terminal basic residues generally 3-10 residues from the proximal arginine and an aromatic or less often another type of bulky hydrophobic residue at position P1'; MPP also prefers polar residues such as histidine, serine, and threonine at positions P2' and P3'.

CPX-6264	Fanconi anemia ID complex	Required for the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICL) and related lesions. Binds to DNA with a preference for branched structures, including Holliday-junctions, overhangs and replication-forks. ICL repair is activated when a replication fork stalls at an ICL, triggering monoubiquitination of the complex by the Fanconi Anemia ubiquitin ligase (CPX-6263), with one ubiquitin molecule being conjugated to each protein subunit. This may convert the ID complex into a clamp that can slide away from its initial location, potentially enabling downstream nucleases and other factors to act on the ICL.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606

CPX-6267	NELF negative elongation factor complex 	Negatively regulates the elongation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. Required for promoter-proximal pausing when elongating Pol II pauses near the promoter, about 20-60 base pairs downstream of the transcription start site, a key event in post-initiation regulation of transcription. SUPT5H (O00267) docks the DSIF complex (CPX-891) to Pol II near the RNA exit channel where it facilitates capping of the nascent RNA. NELF then recognizes the Pol II-SUPT5H interface and associates with the elongation complex as it transcribes through the promoter-proximal region. Binding of newly synthesized RNA by NELF may stabilize its interactions with elongating Pol II at specific loci. Phosphorylation of SUPT5H by P-TEFb (CPX-222/CPX-321/CPX-322) appears to trigger dissociation of NELF from Pol II, enabling Pol II reactivation and resumption of elongation.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606

CPX-627	Interleukin-15 receptor-ligand complex	Transmembrane complex formed on the binding of extracellular interleukin-15 (IL15) to its receptor (IL15R). IL15 binding to the unique high affinity IL15RA and the shared IL2RB and IL2RG subunits results in the assembly of the complete complex, inducing activation of Janus kinases, JAK1 and JAK3, resulting in the phosphorylation of STAT3 via IL2RB and of STAT5 via IL2RG. This causes activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR and Ras/Raf/MAPK signaling cascades, resulting in an anti-apoptotic program. Other signalling pathways include, PDGFR and IL15/Akt/XBP1 to mediate Natural Killer (NK) cell survival, and the trans-endocytosis of the membrane-associated IL15-IL15RA complex into NK cells, leading to the activation of STAT5 and subsequent induction of proliferation and survival signals. IL15 is a pleiotropic cytokine expressed constitutively by monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), keratinocytes, epidermal skin cells, fibroblasts, various epithelial cells, bone marrow stromal cells, and nerve cells. IL15 binding to IL15R mediates signalling activities including the proliferation of Natural Killer (NK) cells, NK-T cells, CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, memory-T cells, intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes and large granular lymphocytes. Thought to have a role in respiratory diseases such as sarcoidosis and tuberculosis through its role in Th1-driven-inflammation, IL15 also negatively regulates apoptosis and its anti-tumour potential makes it an attractive target for cancer immunotherapy.

CPX-631	RXRalpha-VDR nuclear hormone receptor complex	Member of the nuclear receptor family of ligand-regulated transcription factor complexes controlling the expression of numerous genes with a role in cellular differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. The Vitamin D receptor (VDR) mediates the transcriptional effects of Vitamin D and plays a central role in calcium homeostasis. The 9-cis retinoic acid receptor (retinoid X receptor, RXR) is an important member of the nuclear receptor family because it forms heterodimers with many other receptors, including the all-trans retinoic acid receptor (RAR). Receptors bind to hormone response elements (HREs) via their DNA-binding domains (DBD) and contain a C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD) that binds the hormone. Unliganded VDR can occupy its response elements as a homodimer. RXRA-VDR is a non-permissive receptor that cannot be activated by an RXR agonist but only by an agonist of the dominant partner receptor, VDR. Upon binding of ligand, VDR forms a heterodimer with RXRA through their LBDs and binds to Vitamin D response elements. The ligand for RXRA, 9-cis retinoic acid, has the opposite effect of destabilizing the heterodimeric-DNA complex.

CPX-632	RXRalpha-LXRalpha nuclear hormone receptor complex	Member of the nuclear receptor (NR) family of ligand-regulated transcription factor complexes controlling the expression of numerous genes with a role in cellular differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. Key modulator of macrophage cholesterol homeostasis and immune responses. Liver X receptors (LXR) function as lipid-activated transcription factors that mediate cholesterol, glucose and lipid metabolism and reverse cholesterol transport. The 9-cis retinoic acid receptor (retinoid X receptor, RXR) is an important member of the nuclear receptor family because it forms heterodimers with many other receptors, including the all-trans retinoic acid receptor (RAR). The effects of ligands on LXR, RXR, and other NRs are mediated through the ligand-binding domain (LBD). RXRA-LXRA is a permissive receptor that can be activated by the ligands of either partner. Upon ligand binding, the LBD undergoes a conformational change that results in the release of corepressors, the recruitment of coactivators, and the activation of transcription.

The complex is linked to various cellular processes including bulk mRNA degradation, miRNA-mediated repression, translational repression during translational initiation, and general transcription regulation, potentially by promoting the resumption of elongation of arrested RNAPII when it encounters transcriptional blocks in vivo. The complex is required for germ cell development in adult hermaphrodites.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:6239

CPX-635	Exon junction core complex, Magoh variant	Plays a role in translation, surveillance and localization of the maturing mRNA molecules. Deposited by spliceosomes at a conserved position of a pre-messenger RNA strand located upstream of exon junctions formed during RNA splicing. The EJC remains stably bound at this position as the mature messenger ribonucleoprotein particle is exported to the cytoplasm, potentially promoting export through its close association with the TREX complex. Binds RNA primarily through Eif4a3, a sequence-independent DEAD box protein that grasps RNA stably only when associated with its partners, Rbm8a/Y14 and Magoh which inhibit the DEAD-box protein Eif4a3 ATPase activity, trapping the ATP-bound EJC core onto spliced mRNA in a stable conformation. The EJC core serves as a binding platform for additional factors which together then interface with numerous machineries controlling mRNA export, translation, and decay. Discriminates between premature and normal translation termination events by providing architectural information regarding the position of (former) introns. When translation terminates on an mRNA upstream of at least one EJC, Upf3 (Q3ULJ3/Q3ULL6) and its cofactors Upf1 (Q9EPU0) and Upf2 (A2AT37) orchestrate a series of events that destabilize the message by a process known as nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD).

CPX-6363	RSC chromatin remodelling complex	Member of the SWI/SNF family of ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers with a role in contributing to the integrity of centromeric DNA. The RSC complex is generally recruited to RNA polymerase III promoters and is specifically recruited to RNA polymerase II promoters by transcriptional activators and repressors where it is responsible for the transfer of a histone octamer from a nucleosome core particle to naked DNA. The reaction requires ATP and involves an activated RSC-nucleosome intermediate. The remodeling reaction also involves DNA translocation, DNA twist and conformational change. As a reconfigurer of centromeric and flanking nucleosomes, the RSC complex is required both for proper kinetochore function in chromosome segregation and, potentially, for organization of the cellular cytoskeleton. It is also involved in non-homologous end joining.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:284812

CPX-637	ISW1a chromatin remodeling complex	ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex which modulates the structure of chromatin to regulate a variety of cellular processes, including DNA replication, repair, chromosome segregation and transcription. Slides mononucleosomes from the end to the center of DNA and requires the flexible, acidic patch of the histone H4 tail to efficiently dock its translocase on the nucleosome, for stimulating the ATPase activity and inducing nucleosome mobility. Positions histone octamers in dinucleosomes more specifically than in mononucleosomes. Regularly spaces nucleosomes in vitro every 175 bp. ISW1a bound to 33 bp of extranucleosomal DNA at both entry/exit sites is in an inactive conformation, it becomes activated on binding to extranucleosomal DNA at only one entry/exit site. ISW1a bound to only one extranucleosomal DNA makes a stable contact with nucleosomal DNA two helical turns from the dyad axis, and this interaction is lost when ISW1a is bound to extranucleosomal DNA at both entry/exit sites. Required for the transcriptional repression of a number of genes, this set differs from those repressed by ISW1b (CPX-636) with which it shares a catalytic subunit.

CPX-638	Exon junction subcomplex magoh-y14	Component of the exon-junction complex (EJC, CPX-635) that is formed in the nucleus and exported to the cytoplasm as part of the mature messenger ribonucleoprotein particle. Binding of the EJC key regulator Pym1 (Q8CHP5) to Magoh-Y14 in the cytoplasm triggers disassembly of the EJC. Magoh-Y14 complex remains bound in the same position on the spliced mRNA and requires translation of the mRNA for removal. When interacting with Pym1, associates with mRNA-degradation factors, including the mRNA-decapping complex and exoribonucleases and may play a role in preventing mRNA degradation during mRNA biogenesis. This complex itself does not bind RNA. Binding to Ipo13 (Q8K0C1) leads to import back into the nucleus prior to reassembly of the EJC.

CPX-6442	SARS-CoV-2 replication and transcription complex	Replication and transcription complex (RTC) of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus which consists of the polymerase complex (CPX-5742) and 2 helicase molecules (nsp13). Although coronavirus nsp13s have been proposed to unwind RNA in the 5' to 3' direction, the 5' extension of template RNA is fed into the active site of SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 in the 3' to 5' direction. RNA polymerase has been known to possess a “backtrack” feature, in which the productive elongation and translocation complexes are in the same conformation to facilitate reversible backward motion during RNA synthesis. The SARS-CoV-2 RTC structure suggests it has the same function here. The nsp12 nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN) domain possesses guanylyltransferase activity, catalyzing the formation of the cap core structure (GpppA) on the nascent mRNA.

CPX-646	Interleukin-2 receptor-ligand complex	Transmembrane complex formed on the binding of extracellular interleukin-2 (IL-2) to a differentially expressed receptor which can be composed of up to three distinct receptor chains: IL2RA (alpha-chain, IL2RB (beta-chain) and IL2RG (gamma-chain), where IL2RB and IL2RG are essential for signal transduction, whilst IL2RA plays a key role in cytokine presentation to the signaling receptors. Ligand binding results in the assembly of the complete complex, inducing signal transduction through three different signaling pathways: the JAK-STAT pathway, the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and the MAPK/ERK pathway. Binding to IL-2 stimulates phosphorylation of three critical tyrosine residues on the cytoplasmic tail of IL2RB as well as tyrosine phosphorylation of the JAKs. Activation of the JAK/STAT signaling cascade is through IL-2RB-JAK1 and IL-2RG-JAK3 recruitment of predominantly STAT5A and STAT5B. Originally recognized for its ability to stimulate lymphocyte proliferation, the IL-2-IL2R pathway is an integral regulator of healthy and pathalogical immune responses but also plays a key role in regulating the homeostasis of regulatory T cells (T-regs), which express the IL-2R constitutively. Whilst, IL2 shares several actions with IL15, such as stimulating cytotoxic T cells and Natural Killer (NK) cell proliferation, they are not functionally redundant. IL-2 favours maintaining T-reg homeostasis and regulating T helper (Th) differentiation whereas IL-15 favors expansion of CD8 memory cells, NK cells, and NKT cells. Immune activation leads to the shedding of IL2RA, leaving behind a soluble form of IL2R (sIL-2R). Increased levels of sIL2R are considered to be indicative of an on-going immune response making it a useful biomarker for monitoring disease progression. sIL-2R's role in providing immunity or governing self-tolerance is unclear and it is capable of either functioning as a decoy-receptor that reduces the bio-availability of IL2, or enabling in trans activation by presenting IL2 to dimeric IL2R expressing immune cells.

CPX-654	RXRalpha-TRbeta nuclear hormone receptor complex	Member of the nuclear receptor family of ligand-regulated transcription factor complexes controlling the expression of numerous genes with a role in cellular differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. Thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) regulate gene expression in response to thyroid hormone, predominantly triiodothyronine, T3. Thyroid hormones are essential for early development and also for metabolic balance. The 9-cis retinoic acid receptor (retinoid X receptor, RXR) is an important member of the nuclear receptor family because it forms heterodimers with many other receptors, including the all-trans retinoic acid receptor (RAR). Receptors bind to T3 response elements (TREs) via their DNA-binding domains (DBD) and contain a C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD) that binds the hormone. Both THRB isoforms contribute to T3 feedback on thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), with THRB1 having a more important role in the activation of TRH transcription. Unliganded receptor generally represses basal transcription. Unliganded receptor generally represses basal transcription. RXRA-THRB is a non-permissive receptor that cannot be activated by an RXR agonist but only by an agonist of the dominant partner receptor, THRB. Binding of THRB induces a conformation changes which allosterically silences RXR. Upon ligand binding, the LBD undergoes a conformational change that results in the release of corepressors, the recruitment of coactivators, and the activation of transcription.

While alpha-beta TCR (CPX-6482, CPX-6581) expressing T cells are more commonly found in peripheral blood, gamma-delta TCR-expressing T cells constitute the major subset of resident T cells in tissues bordering the external environment such as the dermis, the intestine, the lung and the uterus. Gamma-delta TCRs do not absolutely require classic antigen priming and clonal expansion in the thymus and appear to recognise microorganism-derived proteins and self-proteins (such as heat-shock proteins) without a requirement for antigen pre-processing or major-histocompatibility-complex (MHC) presentation of peptide epitopes. Some gamma-delta T-cell receptors recognise MHC class Ib molecules or structurally diverse and biologically unrelated compounds such as lipopeptides on cell surfaces. Activated cells produce cytokines (IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-17) and chemokines (RANTES, IP-10, lymphotactin), contributing to a rapid, innate-like immune response to a broad spectrum of pathogens during the initiation phase of the immune response. This rapid response bridges the transition from the innate to adaptive immune response. Each TCR possesses unique antigen specificity, determined by the antigen binding site created by the variable regions of the gamma and delta subunits (TRGC1, TRDC). Downstream signalling is activate by LCK (P06239) and FYN (P06241) kinases which phosphorylate the cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) of subunits CD3G, CD3E and CD247. As antigens only bind to the extracellular domains of the gamma and delta subunits and they do not possess ITAMs, information is probably relayed via the ITAMs of the cytoplasmic tails of the CD3 subunits. Gamma-delta TCRs appear to be more efficient in signalling than alpha-beta TCRs. This rapid and un-primed response by T cells expressing gamma-delta TCRs and IL-17 can also induce inflammatory diseases, autoimmunity (in particular psoriasis), and metastasis.

CPX-662	RXRalpha-TRalpha nuclear hormone receptor complex	Member of the nuclear receptor family of ligand-regulated transcription factor complexes controlling the expression of numerous genes with a role in cellular differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. Thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) regulate gene expression in response to thyroid hormone, predominantly triiodothyronine, T3. Thyroid hormones are essential for early development and also for metabolic balance. The 9-cis retinoic acid receptor (retinoid X receptor, RXR) is an important member of the nuclear receptor family because it forms heterodimers with many other receptors, including the all-trans retinoic acid receptor (RAR). Receptors bind to T3 response elements (TREs) via their DNA-binding domains (DBD) and contain a C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD) that binds the hormone. Unliganded receptor generally represses basal transcription. RXRA-THRA is a non-permissive receptor that cannot be activated by an RXR agonist but only by an agonist of the dominant partner receptor, THRA. Binding of THRA induces a conformation changes which allosterically silences RXR. Upon ligand binding, the LBD undergoes a conformational change that results in the release of corepressors, the recruitment of coactivators, and the activation of transcription. Several alternative splice product of THRA, for example variant alpha-2 (P10827-1), have alternative carboxyl-terminal domains, therefore are not capable of binding T3. THRA alpha-2 is not a functional TR but may act as an inhibitor of thyroid hormone action.	NR2B1-NR1A1 complex|Thyroid hormone receptor complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606

ASCC3 is a DNA helicase that unwinds DNA by translocating on one strand in 3'-to-5' direction, thus potentially providing single-stranded DNA as a substrate for de-alkylation repair by ALKBH3. Recruitment of the ASCC complex requires recognition of Lys-64-linked poly-ubiquitin chains by the CUE (IPR003892) domain of ASCC2 whilst ASCC1 appears to modulate the localization of the complex during alkylation damage.

In the absence of agonist, the complex recruits the corepressor proteins NCoR or SMRT and associated factors such as histone deacetylases or DNA-methyl transferases that may lead to an inactive condensed chromatin structure, preventing transcription.

CPX-6702	CD8alpha-beta complex	Integral membrane glycoprotein coreceptor complex that plays an essential role in the immune response and serves multiple functions in responses against both external and internal attacks. In T-cells, functions primarily as a T-cell receptor (TCR) coreceptor for the peptide-bound MHC (pMHC) class I complex. Interacts with the pMHC class I complex via its extracellular immunoglobulin domains, and potentially enhances TCR-pMHC binding of low-affinity TCRs. In turn, recruits the intracellular Src kinase Lck (P06240) to the vicinity of the TCR complex. Lck then initiates different intracellular signaling pathways by phosphorylating various substrates ultimately leading to lymphokine production, motility, adhesion and activation of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs). This mechanism enables CTLs to recognize and eliminate infected cells and tumour cells. Additionally, plays a critical role in thymic selection of CD8+ T-cells. A palmitoylation site in the cytoplasmic tail of CD8B subunit contributes to partitioning of CD8 into the plasma membrane lipid rafts where signaling proteins are enriched.

The Vitamin D receptor (Vdr) mediates the transcriptional effects of Vitamin D and plays a central role in calcium homeostasis. The 9-cis retinoic acid receptor (retinoid X receptor, RXR) is an important member of the nuclear receptor family because it forms heterodimers with many other receptors, including the all-trans retinoic acid receptor (RAR). Receptors bind to hormone response elements (HREs) via their DNA-binding domains (DBD) and contain a C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD) that binds the hormone. Unliganded Vdr can occupy its response elements as a homodimer. Rxra-Vdr is a non-permissive receptor that cannot be activated by an RXR agonist but only by an agonist of the dominant partner receptor, Vdr. Upon binding of ligand, Vdr forms a heterodimer with Rxra through their LBDs and binds to Vitamin D response elements. The ligand for Rxra, 9-cis retinoic acid, has the opposite effect of destabilizing the heterodimeric-DNA complex. Looking at RXRbeta-VDR now.

CPX-674	Calcineurin-Calmodulin-AKAP5 complex, alpha-R1 variant	Calcium-dependent, calmodulin-stimulated protein phosphatase calcineurin in complex with plasma-membrane anchor protein AKAP5. Calcineurin is important for cardiac development and pathophysiology, for nervous-system development and for some of the plastic changes in neurons that are believed to underlie learning and memory. AKAP5 recruits calcineurin to the vicinity of L-type Ca2+ channels for their activation by elevated Ca2+ entering the cell. AKAP5 balances the opposing effects of calcineurin and protein kinase A (PKA) (P17612) on neuronal voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels and coordinates the activities of calcineurin, PKA and PKC on a number of other channels and receptors. Despite its atypical PxIxIT calcineurin-recognition motif that confers stronger binding affinity by calcineurin than other substrates it allows for effective disengagement of calcineurin to couple channel activation with downstream signaling events. The calcineurin-AKAP5 complex has been shown to promote NFAT signaling.

CPX-6741	CD8alpha-beta complex	Integral membrane glycoprotein coreceptor complex that plays an essential role in the immune response and serves multiple functions in responses against both external and internal attacks. In T-cells, functions primarily as a T-cell receptor (TCR, CPX-6581, CPX-6482, CPX-6582, CPX-6603) coreceptor for the peptide-bound MHC (pMHC) class I complex. Interacts with the pMHC class I complex via its extracellular immunoglobulin domains, and potentially enhances TCR-pMHC binding of low-affinity TCRs. In turn, recruits the intracellular Src kinase LCK (P06239) to the vicinity of the TCR complex. LCK then initiates different intracellular signaling pathways by phosphorylating various substrates ultimately leading to lymphokine production, motility, adhesion and activation of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs). This mechanism enables CTLs to recognize and eliminate infected cells and tumour cells. Additionally, plays a critical role in thymic selection of CD8+ T-cells. A palmitoylation site in the cytoplasmic tail of CD8B subunit contributes to partitioning of CD8 into the plasma membrane lipid rafts where signaling proteins are enriched.

CPX-6744	IgD - Ig kappa immunoglobulin complex, constant regions	Membrane-bound or secreted glycoprotein produced by B lymphocytes. In the recognition phase of humoral immunity, the membrane-bound immunoglobulins serve as receptors which, upon binding of a specific antigen, trigger the clonal expansion and differentiation of B lymphocytes into immunoglobulin-secreting plasma cells. Secreted immunoglobulins (also known as antibodies) mediate the effector phase of humoral immunity, which results in the elimination of bound antigens. IgD is the major antigen receptor isotype on the surface of most peripheral B-cells, where it is coexpressed with IgM. IgM and IgD molecules present on B cells have identical V regions and antigen-binding sites.	IgD antibody complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606

CPX-677	C5b6 complement complex	Involved in the complement system. The complement system is a part of the innate immune system that enhances (complements) the ability of antibodies and phagocytic cells to clear microbes and damaged cells from an organism. The complex is formed after C5 cleavage by C5 convertase into C5a and C5b. C5b has a transient binding site for C6. Without C6 binding, C5b will irreversibly decay to a state incapable of binding C6. The complex initiates pore formation via the sequential recruitment of homologous proteins: C7, C8, and 12-18 copies of C9, each of which comprises a central MAC-perforin domain flanked by auxiliary domains. Activation of the complement system results in formation of membrane attack complexes (MACs), pores that disrupt lipid bilayers and lyse bacteria and other pathogens.

MAGOHB-Y14 complex remains bound in the same position on the spliced mRNA and requires translation of the mRNA for removal. When interacting with PYM1, associates with mRNA-degradation factors, including the mRNA-decapping complex and exoribonucleases and may play a role in preventing mRNA degradation during mRNA biogenesis. This complex itself does not bind RNA. Binding to IPO13 (O94829) leads to import back into the nucleus prior to reassembly of the EJC.

CPX-682	Exon junction core complex, MAGOHB variant	Plays a role in translation, surveillance and localization of the maturing mRNA molecules. Deposited by spliceosomes at a conserved position of a pre-messenger RNA strand located upstream of exon junctions formed during RNA splicing. The EJC remains stably bound at this position as the mature messenger ribonucleoprotein particle is exported to the cytoplasm, potentially promoting export through its close association with the TREX complex. Binds RNA primarily through EIF4A3, a sequence-independent DEAD box protein that grasps RNA stably only when associated with its partners, RBM8A/Y14 and MAGOHB which inhibit the DEAD-box protein EIF4A3 ATPase activity, trapping the ATP-bound EJC core onto spliced mRNA in a stable conformation. The EJC core serves as a binding platform for additional factors which together then interface with numerous machineries controlling mRNA export, translation, and decay. Discriminates between premature and normal translation termination events by providing architectural information regarding the position of (former) introns. When translation terminates on an mRNA upstream of at least one EJC, UPF3 (Q9H1J1/Q9BZI7) and its cofactors UPF1 (Q9H1J1) and UPF2 (Q9HAU5) orchestrate a series of events that destabilize the message by a process known as nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD).

Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 is attached to nascent glycoproteins and presents various carbohydrate epitopes to lectins operating as molecular chaperones, cargo receptors, and degradation mediators. The D1 branch of the initial glycoform is capped by a triglucosyl moiety, Glc-alpha1,2-Glc-alpha1,3-Glc. Glucosidase I (Q13724) removes the outermost alpha1,2-linked glucose from the D1 branch and then glucosidase II trims the second and third alpha1,3-linked glucose residues by catalyzing hydrolyses at the Glc-alpha1,3-Glc and Glc-alpha1,3-Man glycosidic linkages. This triggers disengagement of glycoproteins from chaperone complexes for anterograde transport to the Golgi apparatus if they are successfully folded.

CPX-704	RXRalpha-TRalpha nuclear hormone receptor complex	Member of the nuclear receptor family of ligand-regulated transcription factor complexes controlling the expression of numerous genes with a role in cellular differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. Thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) regulate gene expression in response to thyroid hormone, predominantly triiodothyronine, T3. Thyroid hormones are essential for early development and also for metabolic balance. The 9-cis retinoic acid receptor (retinoid X receptor, RXR) is an important member of the nuclear receptor family because it forms heterodimers with many other receptors, including the all-trans retinoic acid receptor (RAR). Receptors bind to T3 response elements (TREs) via their DNA-binding domains (DBD) and contain a C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD) that binds the hormone. Unliganded receptor generally represses basal transcription. RXRA-THRA is a non-permissive receptor that cannot be activated by an RXR agonist but only by an agonist of the dominant partner receptor, THRA. Upon ligand binding, the LBD undergoes a conformational change that results in the release of corepressors, the recruitment of coactivators, and the activation of transcription.

CPX-7041	SARS-CoV-2 Cap(0)-replication and transcription complex	Cap(0)-Replication and transcription complex (RTC) of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. The nsp12 nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN) domain of the RTC (CPX-6442) possesses guanylyltransferase activity which catalyzes the formation of the cap core structure (GpppA) on the nascent mRNA. nsp9 and nsp12 NiRAN domain recruit the nsp14 ExoN domain of the exoribonuclease proof-reading complex, nsp14-nsp10 (CPX-5692), into the Cap(0)-RTC, forming the N7-CCC (co-transcriptional capping complex) to yield cap(0) (7MeGpppA) at the 5' end of pre-mRNA. RNA polymerase has been known to possess a “backtrack” feature, in which the productive elongation and translocation complexes are in the same conformation to facilitate reversible backward motion during RNA synthesis. The SARS-CoV-2 Cap(0)-RTC structure suggests it has the same function here.	RTC|cap(0)-RTC|mCap(0)-RTC|replication-transcription complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:2697049
CPX-7042	SARS-CoV-2 uncleaved Spike protein complex	Spike protein complex of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that binds to human receptor ACE2 (Q9BYF1). May also bind CLEC4M/DC-SIGNR (Q9H2X3) (by homology from SARS-CoV-S (CPX-5694)). Cell entry via binding of Spike to the ACE2 receptor (CPX-5683) relies on two proteolytic cleavage events facilitated by host proteases, such as furin (P09958) and TMPRSS2 (O15393): the first cleavage occurs at the S1/S2 site, the second at the S2' site. Cleavage at the S1/S2 site can occur prior to exit from an infected cell or once bound to ACE2 on the surface of a new host cell. Cleavage at the S2' site occurs only on the surface of the new host cell. While furin is active in the Golgi and on the plasma membrane and can cleave Spike at both cleavage sites, TMPRSS2 only facilitates S2' cleavage on the plasma membrane. While cleaved Spike (CPX-5682) greatly enhances viral entry into the host cell, it is not strictly required for infection and not all Spike complexes on the viral surface are cleaved. Alternatively, virions can enter the cell via the endosomal pathway and the use of an alternative protease, e.g. cathepsin L (P07711). Some variants of Spike carry mutations in the furin cleavage site that increases the proportion of cleaved Spike complexes which is linked to a higher infectivity of these variants.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:2697049

CPX-7088	SARS-CoV uncleaved Spike protein complex	Spike protein complex of the SARS-CoV coronavirus that binds to human receptor ACE2 (Q9BYF1) and CLEC4M/DC-SIGNR (Q9H2X3). Cell entry via binding of Spike to the ACE2 receptor (CPX-5695) relies on two proteolytic cleavage events facilitated by host proteases, such as furin (P09958) and TMPRSS2 (O15393): the first cleavage occurs at the S1/S2 site, the second at the S2' site. Cleavage at the S1/S2 site can occur prior to exit from an infected cell or once bound to ACE2 on the surface of a new host cell. Cleavage at the S2' site occurs only on the surface of the new host cell. While furin is active in the Golgi and on the plasma membrane and can cleave Spike at both cleavage sites, TMPRSS2 only facilitates S2' cleavage on the plasma membrane. While cleaved Spike (CPX-5694) greatly enhances viral entry into the host cell, it is not strictly required for infection and not all Spike complexes on the viral surface are cleaved. Contrary to the activity of Spike in related SARS-CoV-2 (CPX-5682), owing to a different furin cleavage site, cleavage and activation of SARS-CoV Spike by furin and TMPRSS2 is less efficient. It is therefore thought that SARS-CoV virions may rely more heavily on the less efficient cell entry process via endosomes and the use of an alternative protease, e.g. cathepsin L (P07711).			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:694009

Thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) regulate gene expression in response to thyroid hormone, predominantly triiodothyronine, T3. Thyroid hormones are essential for early development and also for metabolic balance. The 9-cis retinoic acid receptor (retinoid X receptor, RXR) is an important member of the nuclear receptor family because it forms heterodimers with many other receptors, including the all-trans retinoic acid receptor (RAR). Receptors bind to T3 response elements (TREs) via their DNA-binding domains (DBD) and contain a C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD) that binds the hormone. Both Thrb isoforms contribute to T3 feedback on thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), with Thrb1 having a more important role in the activation of TRH transcription. Unliganded receptor generally represses basal transcription. Rxra-Thrb is a non-permissive receptor that cannot be activated by an RXR agonist but only by an agonist of the dominant partner receptor, Thrb. Binding of Thrb induces a conformation changes which allosterically silences RXR.

CPX-7121	ERLIN1-ERLIN2 complex	Forms in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lipid raft-like microdomains and mediates mediate inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor processing and regulation of lipid metabolism. Promotes ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) of the activated IP3 receptor and of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (P04035). May also regulate sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) thus playing a role in cholesterol homeostasis. Also identifed in mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes (MAMs), tethering sites between ER and mitochondria which play a key role in the membrane scrambling and function, and may drive mitochondria-ER crosstalk.

CPX-713	RXRalpha-TRalpha nuclear hormone receptor complex	Member of the nuclear receptor family of ligand-regulated transcription factor complexes controlling the expression of numerous genes with a role in cellular differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. Thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) regulate gene expression in response to thyroid hormone, predominantly triiodothyronine, T3. Thyroid hormones are essential for early development and also for metabolic balance. The 9-cis retinoic acid receptor (retinoid X receptor, RXR) is an important member of the nuclear receptor family because it forms heterodimers with many other receptors, including the all-trans retinoic acid receptor (RAR). Receptors bind to T3 response elements (TREs) via their DNA-binding domains (DBD) and contain a C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD) that binds the hormone. Unliganded receptor generally represses basal transcription. Rxra-Thra is a non-permissive receptor that cannot be activated by an RXR agonist but only by an agonist of the dominant partner receptor, Thra. Binding of Thra induces a conformation changes which allosterically silences RXR. Upon ligand binding, the LBD undergoes a conformational change that results in the release of corepressors, the recruitment of coactivators, and the activation of transcription. Several alternative splice product of Thra, for example variant alpha-2 (P63058-1), have alternative carboxyl-terminal domains, therefore are not capable of binding T3. Thra alpha-2 is not a functional TR but may act as an inhibitor of thyroid hormone action.	NR2B1-NR1A1 complex|Thyroid hormone receptor complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:10090
CPX-7142	Hydride transfer complex	Catalyzes a metabolic cycle that transfers a hydride anion (H−) from NADH to NADP+, thus regenerating NAD+ and supplying NADPH. Cytosolic PC appears to supply oxaloacetate for NAD+ regeneration via MDH1, which also produces malate that is then converted back to pyruvate by cytosolic ME1, transferring the hydride ion from NADH to NADP+. This cycle overcomes mitochondrial dysfunction and confers fitness to cells under hypoxic conditions but by-passes senescence which prevents cells bearing oncogenic mutations from expanding.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606

Membrane fission processes include: a) the sorting of multivesicular bodies (MVB) in the endocytic pathway; cargoes destined for inclusion into the MVB pathway are covalently modified with ubiquitin, recognized by ubiquitin-binding domains in the early ESCRTs (ESCRT-0, -I, and -II) and sequestered into endosomal microdomains that bud into the endosome as intralumenal vesicles aided by ESCRT-III, b) downregulation of cell-surface receptors, c) repair of plasma membrane wounds, d) abscission of the cellular bridge during cytokineses, d) nuclear envelope sealing by annular fusion and e) budding of virions (especially HIV-1) from the plasma membrane.

Membrane fission processes include: a) the sorting of multivesicular bodies (MVB) in the endocytic pathway; cargoes destined for inclusion into the MVB pathway are covalently modified with ubiquitin, recognized by ubiquitin-binding domains in the early ESCRTs (ESCRT-0, -I, and -II) and sequestered into endosomal microdomains that bud into the endosome as intralumenal vesicles aided by ESCRT-III, b) downregulation of cell-surface receptors, c) repair of plasma membrane wounds, d) abscission of the cellular bridge during cytokineses, d) nuclear envelope sealing by annular fusion and e) budding of virions (especially HIV-1) from the plasma membrane. The ESCRT machinery seems to play an indirect role in the proper functioning of cellular polarity and migration, the miRNA machinery and gene expression regulation. ESCRT-0 binds to and clusters ubiquitinated cargo for delivery into MVBs, and recruits clathrin, ubiquitin ligases, and deubiquitinating enzymes. ESCRT-0 recruits ESCRT-I which engages ESCRT-II to nucleate ESCRT-III polymerization. VPS4A/B complex, also known as ESCRT-IV, disassembles ESCRT-III to recycle its subunits. The ESCRT-III complex facilitates changes in membrane architecture by oligomerizing to form spiral, filament-like tubules, accumulation of which is associated with membrane constriction and fission. Disassembly of ESCRT-III by VPS4A/B may be a required step for fission.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606

Discovered as a secreted cytokine synthesis inhibitory factor, produced by T helper (Th) 2 cell clones shown to inhibit cytokine production by Th1 cells. Produced by both innate and adaptive immune cells including activated Th cells, B cells, keratinocytes, macrophages and monocytes to function as effector and regulatory molecules of the immune system. A pleiotropic cytokine that inhibits cell-mediated immune responses while enhancing humoral immunity. Its primary role is to suppress immune function by blocking the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines, including IFN-gamma, IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, TNF and GM-CSF in T cells, monocytes, and macrophages, and by inhibiting the expression of cell surface molecules involved in antigen presentation and costimulation.

CPX-742	Interleukin-10 receptor-ligand complex	Interleukin-10, a pleiotropic cytokine with a role in promoting both anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory responses, exerts its function upon binding to its receptor complex, IL10R. Secreted as a homodimer, IL10 activates signaling in receiver cells by engaging two copies of a heterodimeric receptor complex consisting of a high-affinity, IL10 specific receptor subunit, IL10RA, and a low-affinity, shared receptor subunit, IL10RB. IL10RB is essential for signal transduction and is a common receptor for IFNG (P01579) and other IL10 family members including IL22, IL26, IFNL1, IFNL2 and IFNL3. IL10 drives the dimerization of IL10RA and IL10RB, resulting in the transphosphorylation of members of the JAK family of tyrosine-protein kinases as well as phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tails of the receptors and activation of the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription STAT3 and to a slightly lesser extent STAT1, which mediate the diverse functional effects of IL10. The limiting factor for IL10 signaling is the formation of the ternary IL10-IL10RA-IL10RB complex, thought to be influenced both by the affinity of the IL10-IL10RB interaction, as well as the quantity of IL10RB on the cell surface.

During a transcription cycle, Pol II, general transcription factors and the mediator complex (CPX-3227) assemble as the preinitiation complex (PIC) at the promoter. 11-15 base pairs of DNA surrounding the transcription start site are melted and the single-stranded DNA template strand of the promoter is positioned deeply within the central active site cleft of Pol II to form the open complex. After synthesis of about 30 bases of RNA, Pol II releases its contacts with the core promoter and the rest of the transcription machinery (promoter clearance) and enters the stage of transcription elongation in which it moves on the template as the transcript elongates. Pol II appears to oscillate between inactive and active conformations at each step of nucleotide addition.	Gdown1-containing Pol II complex|Pol II complex|RNAPII complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606
CPX-7482	DNA-directed RNA polymerase III complex, POLR3GL variant	Catalyzes the transcription of RNA from an DNA template by acting as a nucleotidyl transferase that polymerizes ribonucleotides at the 3' end of an RNA transcript. Responsible for the transcription of genes encoding short non-coding RNAs, such as tRNA, 5S rRNA and U6 snRNA transcripts. Pol III machinery recognizes conserved promoter elements located within the transcribed region, generally the box A and box B sequences, which contribute to the D- and T-loops in the tRNA structure. POLR3F, POLR3GL and POLR3C play a role in transcription initiation whereas the POLR3D-POLR3E heterodimer is crucial for the correct recognition of the termination signals of class III genes. POLR3K is required for RNA cleavage. Pol III initiation does not require ATP hydrolysis to open a transcription bubble to isolate and secure the template strand in the catalytic site and Pol III is capable of reinitiating transcription more rapidly on the same gene after the first transcription cycle without being released (facilitated reinitiation), resulting in a higher initiation efficiency; this appears to require an POLR3K-dependent conformational change of Pol III.

CPX-8009	Sodium:potassium-exchanging ATPase complex, FXYD1 variant	An ATPase-dependent transmembrane transport complex capable of generating electrochemical gradients by exchanging three intracellular sodium ions for two extracellular potassium ions during each cycle of ATP hydrolysis. Na+/K+ pumps can also generate an inward current of protons. Each transport cycle comprises a sequence of conformational transitions that permit extracellular K+ ions to access the binding sites in phosphorylated pumps and cytoplasmic Na+ ions to access the sites after dephosphorylation . Binding of the third Na+ ion triggers autophosphorylation, and binding of the second K+ ion prompts auto-dephosphorylation. This coupling of alternating ion access to ATP hydrolysis ensures forward, energetically uphill, progress of the Na+/K+ transport cycle. The larger pumped Na+ efflux than K+ influx constitutes outward current, a direction tending to make the membrane potential more negative. However, because each step in the cycle is reversible , if the normally transported intracellular Na+ and extracellular K+ are both scarce, the cycle can run backward, thus synthesizing ATP and generating inward, depolarizing current. Variants containing ATP1A1-ATP1B1 appear to be most widely expressed.

CPX-806	Ndc80 complex	Crucial for the stable kinetochore-microtubule attachments that are needed to sustain the centromere tensions involved in achieving proper chromosome alignment in eukaryotic cells. Plays a role in chromosome alignment and microtubule-dependent control of Mad-1/Mad-2 (CPX-402) and dynein complexes at kinetochores, and also chromosome segregation in mitosis and meiosis and spindle checkpoint activity. The complex is recruited to microtubules by kinetochore protein knl-1, which in turn is recruited by knl-3, a component of the MIND complex (CPX-807). Incorrect microtubule binding is controlled by phosphorylation of the ndc-80 subunit by ipl-1/Aurora kinase B. Phosphorylation of ndc-80 reduces the microtubule binding affinity of the complex. Erroneous microtubule-kinetochore attachments are also controlled by the Rzz complex (CPX-810), which interacts with the Ndc80 complex to inhibit irregular microtubule binding. This inhibition is relieved by recruitment of dynein to kinetochores by the coiled-coil protein Spindly/spdl-1. Synergistically enhances the affinity of the Ska-1 complex (CPX-811) for microtubules, which may furthermore allow the Ndc80 complex to track depolymerizing microtubules.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:6239

CPX-816	RXRalpha-RARalpha-NCOA2 retinoic acid receptor complex	Member of the nuclear receptor family of ligand-regulated transcription factor complexes controlling the expression of numerous genes with a role in cellular differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. The 9-cis retinoic acid receptor (retinoid X receptor, RXR) is an important member of the nuclear receptor family because it forms heterodimers with many other receptors, including the all-trans retinoic acid receptor (RAR). RAR and RXR transduce the retinoid signal into a variety of genetic responses, and their functions underlie the essential role played by retinoids in the development and homeostasis of vertebrates. A general model of RAR-RXR-mediated transcription proposes that unliganded RAR-RXR heterodimers are bound to regulatory elements of their target genes and interact with transcriptional repressor complexes such as NCOR/SMRT/SIN3 to recruit histone deacetylases that lead to repression of target gene transcription. Binding of agonist ligand to the nuclear receptor, triggers a conformational change in the ligand binding domain (LBD) with the repositioning of the C-terminal helix H12 creating a binding surface that allow coactivator to bind. Antagonist ligands that prevent the C-terminal helix H12 from adopting its active conformation facilitate the interactions with corepressors.

CPX-818	RXRalpha-RARalpha-NCOA2 retinoic acid receptor complex	Member of the nuclear receptor family of ligand-regulated transcription factor complexes controlling the expression of numerous genes with a role in cellular differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. The 9-cis retinoic acid receptor (retinoid X receptor, RXR) is an important member of the nuclear receptor family because it forms heterodimers with many other receptors, including the all-trans retinoic acid receptor (RAR). RAR and RXR transduce the retinoid signal into a variety of genetic responses, and their functions underlie the essential role played by retinoids in the development and homeostasis of vertebrates. A general model of RAR-RXR-mediated transcription proposes that unliganded RAR-RXR heterodimers are bound to regulatory elements of their target genes and interact with transcriptional repressor complexes such as NCOR/SMRT/SIN3 to recruit histone deacetylases that lead to repression of target gene transcription. Binding of agonist ligand to the nuclear receptor, triggers a conformational change in the ligand binding domain (LBD) with the repositioning of the C-terminal helix H12 creating a binding surface that allow coactivator to bind. Antagonist ligands that prevent the C-terminal helix H12 from adopting its active conformation facilitate the interactions with corepressors.

CPX-833	Interleukin-21 receptor-ligand complex	Transmembrane complex formed on the binding of an extracellular interleukin-21 (IL21) to its receptor. Ligand binding results in the assembly of the complete complex where signalling is dependent upon IL21 binding to the unique ligand-binding IL21R and the common-gamma chain receptor, IL2RG. IL21R and IL2RG dimerization leads to the transphosphorylation of Janus kinases, JAK1 and JAK3, which in turn leads to the phosphorylation and activation of transcription factors, Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, STAT3 and, to a lesser extent, STAT1 and STAT5, which subsequently translocate into the nucleus where they induce the transcription of target genes. In addition to the JAK/STAT pathway, IL21 also signals via the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. IL21 mediates signalling through the IL21 receptor, exerting pleiotropic effects on B, CD4 T cells, cytotoxic CD8 T and natural killer (NK) cells. IL21 activates T follicular helper cells and B cells to promote germinal centre response and thereby the formation of immunological memory. Implicated in multiple autoimmune disorders including systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease, but capable of stimulating antiviral and antitumor responses. IL21 signalling strength correlates with antibody production and IL21 signalling is considered important in antibody production post-immunisation.

CPX-847	TMEM219-Interleukin-13 decoy-receptor-ligand alpha 2 complex	Transmembrane receptor complex. IL13RA2 was initially considered solely as a decoy receptor which elicited IL13 antagonistic responses, because of its short cytoplasmic tail. However, the phosphorylation of a Tyr-369 allows for the recruitment of phosphatases and kinases enabling IL13-mediated IL13RA2 signalling to occur via STAT6 (P42226) independent pathways. This leads to the subsequent activation of the activator protein 1 (AP-1) complex composed of proteins from the FOS (P01100), JUN (P05412), ATF and JDP families as well as the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK1/2) to promote tumour invasion, metastasis, and fibrosis through the production of TGFB1 (P01137). TMEM219 facilitates IL13 and IL13RA2 binding and enhances the role of IL13RA2 as mostly, a decoy receptor. IL13RA2 also forms a complex with Chitinase-3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1, P36222) and TMEM219 (CPX-9184). IL13RA2 N-glycosylation is a critical determinant of whether it binds CHI3L1 or IL13; IL13 binding to IL13RA2 is dependent on each of four sites of N-glycosylation in IL13RA2, with increased N-glycosylation resulting in increased IL13 binding and signalling. The over-expression of IL13RA2 in the epidermal and dermal compartments in skin lesions of patients with atopic dermatitis suggests that it attenuates IL13 mediated inflammatory responses.

CPX-85	Mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint MAD1-MAD2 complex	Acts at the spindle checkpoint, in a surveillance mechanism that mediates a delay in the onset of anaphase, until all chromosomes are properly attached to the mitotic or meiotic spindle. Inhibits Cdc20, the mitotic co-activator of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Mad2 adopts two distinct conformations; when unbound, it adopts an open conformation (O-Mad2) but upon binding to Mad1, the Mad2 C-terminal tail crosses the entire surface of the beta-sheet and locks Mad1. Upon mitotic entry, the Mad1-C-Mad2 core complex is recruited to kinetochores. Because Mad2 can dimerise, O-Mad2 from the cytosol can then be recruited to kinetochore-bound Mad1-C-Mad2. C-Mad2 within the Mad1-C-Mad2 core complex acts as a prion-like template, catalysing the conversion of additional O-Mad2 proteins to the closed conformation and in doing so binding Cdc20.

CPX-87	Mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint Mad1-Mad2 complex	Acts at the spindle checkpoint, in a surveillance mechanism that mediates a delay in the onset of anaphase, until all chromosomes are properly attached to the mitotic or meiotic spindle. Inhibits Cdc20, the mitotic co-activator of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Mad2 adopts two distinct conformations; when unbound, it adopts an open conformation (O-Mad2) but upon binding to Mad1, the Mad2 C-terminal tail crosses the entire surface of the beta-sheet and locks Mad1. Upon mitotic entry, the Mad1-C-Mad2 core complex is recruited to kinetochores. Because Mad2 can dimerise, O-Mad2 from the cytosol can then be recruited to kinetochore-bound Mad1-C-Mad2. C-Mad2 within the Mad1-C-Mad2 core complex acts as a prion-like template, catalysing the conversion of additional O-Mad2 proteins to the closed conformation and in doing so binding Cdc20.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:10090

Acts as the main driver of fast inhibitory neurotransmission in the nervous system. GABA-A receptor assemble in specific combinations of receptor subunits from a pool of nineteen in a cell-type specific manner, giving rise to receptors with distinct distributions and functions in both physiological and disease states. Predominantly expressed in the cerebral cortex, the GABA-A, alpha-5 receptor subtypes constitute less than 5% of the entire receptor population but up to 25% of the receptor subtype are located in the crucial learning and memory-associated area of the brain; the hippocampus. Largely absent at GABAergic synapses, exhibit little synaptic phasic inhibition, but abundant in the dendritic regions of extrasynaptic sites, and mediate tonic inhibition with continuously occurring smaller amplitude. Their many allosteric sites, which bind compounds with anticonvulsant, anti-anxiety, analgesic, sedative and anaesthetic properties make GABA-A receptors attractive drug targets: 1) Positive allosteric modulation of GABA-A alpha-5 receptor subtypes can selectively decrease hippocampal activity and reverse psychosis-like physiological and behavioural changes in rats; may potentially help treat patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and comorbid psychosis; allopregnanolone (CHEBI:50169), a naturally occurring progesterone derivative, is a positive allosteric modulator referred to as brexanolone when used for the medical treatment of moderate to severe postpartum depression. 2) Negative-allosteric modulators for reducing their tonic inhibition have been shown to enhance learning and memory in neurological disorders such as schizophrenia, Down syndrome, and autism with a possible alternative benzodiazepine binding site.

CPX-871	RXRbeta-VDR nuclear hormone receptor complex	Member of the nuclear receptor family of ligand-regulated transcription factor complexes controlling the expression of numerous genes with a role in cellular differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. The Vitamin D receptor (VDR) mediates the transcriptional effects of Vitamin D and plays a central role in calcium homeostasis. The 9-cis retinoic acid receptor (retinoid X receptor, RXR) is an important member of the nuclear receptor family because it forms heterodimers with many other receptors, including the all-trans retinoic acid receptor (RAR). Receptors bind to hormone response elements (HREs) via their DNA-binding domains (DBD) and contain a C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD) that binds the hormone. Unliganded VDR can occupy its response elements as a homodimer. RXRB-VDR is a non-permissive receptor that cannot be activated by an RXR agonist but only by an agonist of the dominant partner receptor, VDR. Upon binding of ligand, VDR forms a heterodimer with RXRB through their LBDs and binds to Vitamin D response elements. The ligand for RXRB, 9-cis retinoic acid, has the opposite effect of destabilizing the heterodimeric-DNA complex.

This is achieved by oxidizing ubiquinol (ubihydroquinone) which reacts from the membrane phase, reducing cytochrome c in the intermembrane space, and using the free energy change to transport H+ ions across the membrane from the matrix to the inter membrane space. Quinol oxidation occurs in a bifurcated reaction, in which one electron is transferred to a high potential chain and the other to a low potential chain.

Unrestrained IL17 signalling is associated with autoimmune diseases and cancer progression, but it is also crucial for protection from fungal and bacterial infections, including the commensal Candida albicans and Klebsiella pneumoniae. IL17 is also thought to play a dominant protective role in maintaining intestinal barrier integrity.

CPX-88	Mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint complex MAD2	The Spindle Assembly complex ensures accurate chromosome segregation by delaying anaphase entry by inhibiting Cdc20, the mitotic co-activator of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Mad2 adopts two distinct conformations; when unbound, it adopts an open conformation (O-Mad2) but upon binding to Mad1, the Mad2 C‐terminal tail crosses the entire surface of the beta‐sheet and locks Mad1. Upon mitotic entry, the Mad1–C-Mad2 core complex is recruited to kinetochores. Because Mad2 can dimerise, O-Mad2 from the cytosol can then be recruited to kinetochore-bound Mad1–C-Mad2. C-Mad2 within the Mad1–C-Mad2 core complex acts as a prion-like template, catalysing the conversion of additional O-Mad2 proteins to the closed conformation and in doing so binding Cdc20.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606
CPX-880	MBD2/NuRD nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase complex	Corepressor complex that couples histone deacetylase and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling activities. It regulates the higher-order structure of chromatin, making chromatin more compact by removing acetyl groups from nucleosomes, and has important roles in the regulation of gene expression and DNA damage repair. The core of the complex is composed of six groups of proteins, each one with several paralogues (HDAC1/2, MTA1/2/3, RBBP4/7, GATAD2A/B, MBD2, and CHD3/4). Combinatorial assembly of these isoforms contributes to the targeting and function of the complex. It is currently not known whether GATAD2A/GATAD2B, RBBP4/RBBP7, and MTA1/MTA2/MTA3 form heterodimers/trimers or mutually exclusive homodimers/trimers. The CHD3/4 ATPase, utilizes energy derived from hydrolysis of ATP for DNA sliding and repositioning of nucleosomes. The second catalytic subunit, HDAC1/2 (histone deacetylase), deacetylates acetylated lysine residues of histone and non-histone proteins. This dual enzymatic activity is proposed to be important for the efficient formation of heterochromatin with densely packed hypoacetylated nucleosomes and the rapid termination of gene transcription. In addition to the well-described core subunits, a large number of proteins have been reported to interact with the NuRD complex, like DOC1 (O14519), KPNA2 (P52292), ZMYND8(Q9ULU4), ZNF512B/532/592/687(Q96KM6, Q9HCE3, Q92610, Q8N1G0), SALL4 (Q9UJQ4), PRMT5 (O14744), MEP50 (Q9BQA1).

CPX-8806	20S proteasome complex	Primordial protein-degrading machine essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis, possibly aided by loosely associated ATPase activators. An integral part of the 26S proteasome, but also exists as a free complex in many cell types. Once considered as either a proteasome assembly intermediate, 26S breakdown product from disassembly or stand-alone proteolytic enzyme complex, there is evidence for the independent direct action of the 20S proteasome on disordered, oxidized and damaged proteins. Plays an important role in adaptation to oxidative stress and the adaptive immune response. Mediates ubiquitin-independent protein degradation through association with PA200 and PA28. Required in several pathways including spermatogenesis (20S-PA200 complex) or generation of a subset of MHC class I-presented antigenic peptides (20S-PA28 complex). Circulating 20S proteasomes present in human plasma are known to increase significantly under various pathological conditions including acute respiratory disease, autoimmune disorders and cancerous tumours. The correlation with disease progression suggests a potential role as a biomarker for disease state and treatment efficacy. Dysregulated proteasome function has been implicated, as a primary cause or a secondary consequence, in the pathogenesis of a broad array of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s diseases.	20S core particle complex|20S subcomplex|Constitutive catalytic core particle complex|Proteasome activator complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606

CPX-881	Calcineurin-Calmodulin-AKAP5 complex, alpha-R1 variant	Calcium-dependent, calmodulin-stimulated protein phosphatase calcineurin in complex with plasma-membrane anchor protein Akap5. Calcineurin is important for cardiac development and pathophysiology, for nervous-system development and for some of the plastic changes in neurons that are believed to underlie learning and memory. Akap5 recruits calcineurin to the vicinity of L-type Ca2+ channels for their activation by elevated Ca2+ entering the cell. Akap5 balances the opposing effects of calcineurin and protein kinase A (PKA) (P05132) on neuronal voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels and coordinates the activities of calcineurin, PKA and PKC on a number of other channels and receptors. Despite its atypical PxIxIT calcineurin-recognition motif that confers stronger binding affinity by calcineurin than other substrates, it allows for effective disengagement of calcineurin to couple channel activation with downstream signaling events. The calcineurin-Akap5 complex has been shown to promote NFAT signaling.

Functions to restrain T cell-mediated inflammation and plays an important role in immune homeostasis through its ability to: modify CD4+ and CD8+ T cell effector functions, promote T regulatory (Treg) responses, mobilize a suppressive transcriptional network through activation of SOCS (suppressors of cytokine signalling), downregulate proinflammatory cytokines IFNG (P01579), TNF (P01375) and IL17, and induce the production of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10 by T cells. Interestingly, IL27 suppresses IL10 production by human monocytes. IL27A is secreted bound to IL27B mainly by antigen presenting cells (APCs) such as monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). Varying levels of IL-27 is also secreted by other cells such as myeloid-derived supressor cells, CD4+, CD8+ T cells, osteoclasts and activated B cells. Specific signaling stimulation, including Toll-like receptor (TLR9) and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) also regulates IL-27 expression. IL27 possesses both pro-tumourigenic and anti-tumourigenic functions. IL27 induction of IL10 in T cells, leads to IL-10 inhibiting antitumor immunity. It is considered therapeutically important due to its ability to induce inhibitory receptors.

CPX-8826	Soluble tumor necrosis factor complex	Potent pro-inflammatory cytokine capable of exerting pleiotropic effects on a variety of cell types. Belongs to the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily of type II transmembrane proteins. Mainly secreted by macrophages, T helper 1 and natural killer cells, TNF is expressed on activated macrophages and lymphocytes. Generated as a precursor form known as transmembrane TNF (mTNF, CPX-8931), TACE (ADAM17) cleavage of mTNF results in the release of a soluble form (sTNF, this complex) with the residual cytoplasmic domain of mTNF migrating back into the nucleus of mTNF producing cells. sTNF exerts its functions through either type-1 (TNR1A, P19438) or type-2 (TNR1B, P20333) TNF receptors and while mTNF can act through either receptor type, its activities are mainly mediated through TNR1B, its primary biological target. Both the soluble and the transmembrane forms play a role in inflammatory responses and whilst mTNF exerts its biological function through cell-to-cell contact to moderate inflammation, sTNF, acts at sites remote from the TNF-producing cells to drive inflammation. Both protective and pathogenic, it induces cell death in response to microbial infection but behaves aberrantly when induced as a result of environmental or genetic factors, thereby driving the pathogenesis of inflammatory disorders.

CPX-8828	sTNF-TNR1A receptor-ligand core complex, BIRC2 variant	A membrane-bound tumor necrosis factor-receptor signaling complex (Complex I) formed on the binding of the soluble form of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, tumour necrosis factor (sTNF, CPX-8826). This activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF-kappa-B) signalling pathways, leading to proinflammatory gene expression and promoting cell survival. The Ripoptosome (CPX-1907, Complex II) originates from the dissociation of Complex I components from the receptor and promotes cell apoptosis. TNF, a key regulator of T regulatory cells, is mainly secreted by macrophages, T helper 1 and natural killer cells, while its receptor component TNFRSF1A is ubiquitously expressed on almost all human tissues. Intracellular signaling is triggered by ligand-bound receptors assembling into higher-order clusters. Soluble TNFA triggers more robust clustering of TNFR1 than membrane-bound ligand. TNFR1-mediated signaling is therefore generally caused by the activation due to sTNFA over mTNFA. TNFA-TNFRSF1A signalling complex formation is indirectly influenced by TNFA-TNFRSF1B activation and the cross-talk between the receptor complexes is central to cell-survival, proliferation or death.

CPX-8830	Interleukin-1 alpha-soluble receptor type 1 complex	Complex formed on the binding of a pre-bound mature form of interleukin-1 alpha (IL1A) and a soluble form of its receptor, interleukin-1R1 (sIL1R1) to its coreceptor, interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP). Recruitment of IL1RAP completes complex assembly and initiates activation of the NFKB signalling pathway. A member of the IL1 family of cytokines, IL1A is closely related to interleukin-1 beta (IL1B, P01584) carrying out similar biological functions by binding to their shared receptor complex. Although both IL1A and IL1B function via the same IL1R1 to drive an inflammatory response, IL1A acts as an alarmin which regulates local inflammation while IL1B acts as a master regulator of systemic inflammation. IL1A is synthesized as a precursor protein and is processed by calpain II (P17655) to produce a more active, mature form. IL1A activity is regulated by two forms of the IL1R1: a membrane-bound form (mIL1R1) and a soluble form (sIL1R1, this complex) created through proteolytic release of the ectodomain (ECD) of mIL1R1 via matrix metalloproteases. Both forms of IL1R1 are biologically active and the ECD in both forms is vital for ligand recognition and binding.

CPX-8834	Interleukin-4 receptor-ligand type-1 complex	Transmembrane complex formed on the binding of an extracellular interleukin-4 (IL4) to either a type-1 IL4 receptor composed of IL4R and IL2RG or a type-2 IL4 receptor, composed of IL4R and IL13RA1 (CPX-624). Ligand binding results in the assembly of the complete complex, which induces signaling mediated principally through the IL4R chain and involves activation of the transcription factor, signal transducer and activator of transcription-6 (STAT6). IL4 binding to the type-1 IL4 receptor induces the phosphorylation of the Janus kinase, JAK1 associated with the IL4R chain and JAK3 associated with the IL2RG. JAK1/JAK3 subsequently phosphorylate IL4R itself, as well as STAT6, resulting in STAT6 translocation to the nucleus and transcription of IL4-responsive genes. IL4 mediated signalling through the IL4R generates immunity to helminthic infections and enables the inactivation of toxins. Expressed in neurons, IL4R plays a key role in modulating neuronal death through STAT6 activation during ischemic attacks. Stimulating microglial phagocytosis, IL4 enables efficient clearance of apoptotic neurons allowing for repair. Systemic administration of IL4 has been shown to reduce ischemic lesions and improves neurologic function after a stroke.	IL-4 receptor complex|IL-4RA-IL-2RG complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606

CPX-8836	Interleukin-27 receptor-ligand complex	Transmembrane complex formed on the binding of the dimeric, extracellular interleukin-27 (IL-27, CPX-8822) to its receptor composed of IL-6RB (gp130) and the IL-27RA chains. Ligand binding results in the assembly of the complete complex, inducing the transphosphorylation of JAK1/2 molecules and phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tails of the receptors. STAT monomers bind to the phosphorylated site of the receptor and are phosphorylated by JAK. Phosphorylated STATs dissociate from the receptors, dimerize, and translocate into the nucleus where they induce the transcription of target genes. IL-27 activation of STATs is dependent on the cell-type and activation state, for example, STAT1, STAT3, STAT5 and low amounts of STAT4 are activated by IL-27 in CD4+ cells. IL-27 induction of T helper 1 (Th1) differentiation is thought to occur through the p38 MAPK/T-bet and ICAM-1/LFA-1/ERK1/2 signaling cascade. A pleiotropic cytokine with both anti- and pro-inflammatory activity, IL-27 is capable of exerting both innate and adaptive immune responses. In myeloid cells, IL-27 possesses both pro-apoptotic functions and anti-apoptotic functions through activation of STAT1 and STAT3, respectively. Increases neuronal survival in various diseases and injuries of the central nervous system (CNS) and IL-27 binding to gp130 plays a critical role in reducing ischemia reperfusion injury through the activation of STAT3, to promote the expression of anti-apoptotic protein BCL2.

CPX-8841	PA200-20S single-capped proteasome	Complex formed upon a 200 kDa proteasome activator (PA200) binding either symmetrically or asymmetrically to the alpha-rings of the multicatalytic constitutive cylindrical 20S core complex (CPX-8806), composed of four heteroheptameric rings, of which the outer two are composed of alpha subunits (1-7) and the inner two of beta subunits (1-7). PA200 binds in an ubiquitin- and ATP-independent manner to either one (single-cap, this complex) or both ends (double-capped, CPX-9063) of the 20S Proteasome, but the efficiency of substrate processing by single and double-capped proteasomes in not known. A nuclear-localized proteasomal regulator, PA200 enhances the 20S proteasome's ability to degrade short peptides, disordered proteins, and PA200-bound inositol phosphates act on acetylated core (AC) histones during DNA repair and replication stress in an ubiquitin-independent manner. Also implicated in mitochondrial fission, turnover of ribosome-related transcription factor Sfp1 and maintaining intracellular glutamine levels. Thought not essential for DNA repair, the PA200 component is more sensitive to DNA damage and PA200-hybrid proteasomes are known to form in response to ionizing radiation. External stimuli and diseases can change a proteasome's composition, thereby affecting the proteasome's substrate specificity and consequently protein homeostasis within a cell. Decreased proteasome activity is linked to neurodegerative disorders and cardiac dysfunction through the accumulation of proteins while, enhanced proteasome activity and induced-expression of certain proteasome components are implicated in muscle wasting conditions and several cancers.

CPX-8842	PA28-alphabeta double-capped 20S proteasome complex	Multi-enzyme complex that functions as the primary degradation machinery for the selective turnover of surplus or damaged proteins within the cell. The core contains the protease active sites (chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like and peptidylglutamyl-peptide hydrolyzing) that perform the proteolysis reactions in an internal chamber. Regulatory particles referred to as 'caps' act as a discriminating gateway for potential substrates. This complex is formed upon the endogenous proteasomal activator, PA28, a 28 kDa protein binding to the 20S proteasome (CPX-8806). PA28 exists as three highly homologous isoforms, alpha, beta and gamma (Q06323, Q9UL46 and P61289 respectively). The three subunits differ significantly in their biochemical and biological properties. PA28-alpha and PA28-beta favour the release of peptide products by the proteasome and are specifically involved in optimizing MHC class 1 antigen presentation. PA28-alpha and PA28-beta bind in an ATP-independent manner to either one (single-cap, CPX-9002) or both ends (double-capped, this complex) of the of the 20S proteasome, but the efficiency of substrate processing by single and double-capped proteasomes in not known. Binding of the activator modifies the 20S peptidase and opens its outer alpha-ring gates allowing substrate entry to the antechamber through an internal activation loop. Regulates protein degradation either in a regulated manner upon specific molecular cues or acts on damaged and disordered proteins. Plays a key role under oxidative stress conditions to degrade damaged and unfolded proteins and is up-regulated by interferon-gamma during antigen presentation. Tumorigenesis of PA28-alpha is unclear but up-regulation of the subunit is associated with several cancers, including ovarian, prostate and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), and interestingly, silencing it suppressed OSCC cell growth and metastasis.	11S regulator - 20S complex|Multicatalytic protease activator - 20S Proteasome complex|PA28-20S complex|Proteasome activator 28 - 20S Proteasome complex|Proteasome activator 28 alpha-beta - 20S Proteasome complex|Reg-alpha-Reg-beta 20S complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606

NSUN4 has 5-methylcytosine rRNA methyltransferase complex which targets C911 of the 12S rRNA in the 28S small ribosomal subunit (CPX-5225) but this may be independent of complex formation.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606
CPX-8861	Cav1.2 voltage-gated calcium channel complex, CACNA2D1-CACNB3 variant	Voltage‐gated calcium channel which reacts to membrane depolarization by opening to allow Ca2+ to move down an electrochemical gradient. The L-type, high voltage-activated Cav1.2 channel is responsible for excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling of cardiac and, to some extent, smooth muscle. It relays an excitatory depolarization in the T-tubular membrane to the calcium release channel in the sarcoplasmatic membrane. More specifically, rapid depolarization-induced conformational changes of the complex stimulates calcium efflux from the sarcoplasmatic reticulum through the Ryanodine 2 complex (CPX-3156) calcium release channel, which subsequently triggers the contractile apparatus until the calcium concentration is reduced again due to re-uptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum by the Ca2+-ATPase, ATP2A1 (O14983).

More specifically, rapid depolarization-induced conformational changes of the complex stimulates calcium efflux from the sarcoplasmatic reticulum through the Ryanodine 2 complex (CPX-3156) calcium release channel, which subsequently triggers the contractile apparatus until the calcium concentration is reduced again due to re-uptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum by the Ca2+-ATPase, ATP2A1 (O14983).

TFIIIC complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:284812
CPX-8904	General transcription factor TFIIIB complex	Transcription factor complex required for Pol III transcription complex assembly which transcribes short noncoding RNA genes. Cooperates with TFIIIC (CPX-8903) to recruit Pol III to different types of gene promoters and form the preinitiation complex (PIC). Once assembled upstream of the start site, TFIIIB generates a significant DNA distortion of the class III gene promoter through the SPT15 and BDP1 subunits.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:284812
CPX-8905	DNA-directed RNA polymerase III complex	Catalyzes the transcription of RNA from an DNA template by acting as a nucleotidyl transferase that polymerizes ribonucleotides at the 3-prime end of an RNA transcript. Responsible for the transcription of genes encoding small structured RNAs such as tRNAs, the 7 SL lncRNA, spliceosomal U6 snRNA and ribosomal 5S RNA. Pol III machinery recognizes conserved promoter elements located within the transcribed region, generally the box A and box B sequences, which contribute to the D- and T-loops in the tRNA structure. rpc6, rpc31 and rpc82 play a role in transcription initiation whereas the rpc37-rpc53 heterodimer is crucial for the correct recognition of the termination signals of class III genes. rpc11 is required for RNA cleavage. Pol III is capable of reinitiating transcription more rapidly on the same gene after the first transcription cycle without being released (facilitated reinitiation), resulting in a higher initiation efficiency; this appears to require an rpc11-dependent conformational change of Pol III. The core complex is believed to assemble in the cytoplasm before being transported to the nucleus.	Pol III alpha complex|RNAPIII complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:284812

CPX-891	DSIF transcription elongation factor complex	An essential RNA polymerase II elongation factor which functions in the control of RNAP II processivity. Mediates both activation and inhibition of transcription elongation, and plays a role in pre-mRNA processing. Required for promoter-proximal pausing when elongating Pol II pauses near the promoter, about 20-60 base pairs downstream of the transcription start site, a key event in post-initiation regulation of transcription. SUPT5H docks DSIF to Pol II near the RNA exit channel where it facilitates capping of the nascent RNA . The negative elongation factor (NELF, CPX-6267) complex then recognizes the Pol II-SUPT5H interface and associates with the elongation complex as it transcribes through the promoter-proximal region. Phosphorylation of SUPT5H by P-TEFb (CPX-222/CPX-321/CPX-322) appears to trigger dissociation of NELF from Pol II, enabling Pol II reactivation and resumption of elongation.

Restricted to processing linear and circular single-stranded RNAs only. RNAs with complex secondary structures, particularly at the 3' end of the molecule, may have to be unwound or pre-processed by co-factors prior to entering the complex. Although some RNAs may be targeted directly to the catalytic subunits, the majority of substrates enter the barrel-like structure of the exosome through a pore at the centre of the cap and are threaded through the central channel in a 3' to 5' orientation. The ribonuclease activity of the catalytic subunits facilitates the degradation process.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:284812
CPX-8916	CRL3 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, SPOP-SPOPL variant	E3 ubiquitin ligase which catalyzes the transfer of ubiquitin from an E2 enzyme to a substrate bound to a substrate receptor by promoting the formation of an isopeptide bond between the Ub carboxy-terminus and specific lysine side chains on the substrate. SPOP is required to maintain normal cellular growth and development and its targets include the polycomb protein BMI1 (P35226), the apoptosis factor DAXX (Q9UER7), the pancreatic and duodenal homeobox protein PDX1 (P52945), and the Hedgehog signaling transcription factors GLI2 (P10070) and GLI3 (P10071). SPOP forms linear higher-order oligomers which enables it to present multiple MATH domains (IPR002083) for binding to multiple low-affinity motifs in a single substrate (CPX-2300) however binding to SPOPL restricts self-assembly due to the presence of an inhibitory structural element within the SPOPL BACK domain.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606

CPX-8931	Transmembrane tumor necrosis factor complex	Potent pro-inflammatory cytokine capable of exerting pleiotropic effects on a variety of cell types. Belongs to the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily of type II transmembrane proteins. Mainly secreted by macrophages, T helper 1 and natural killer cells, it is expressed on activated macrophages and lymphocytes. Generated as a precursor form known as transmembrane TNF(mTNF, this complex), TACE (ADAM17) cleavage of mTNF results in the release of a soluble form (sTNF, CPX-8826) with the residual cytoplasmic domain of mTNF migrating back into the nucleus of mTNF producing cells. sTNF exerts its functions through either type-1 (TNR1A, P19438) or type-2 (TNR1B, P20333) TNF receptors and while mTNF can act through either receptor type, its activities are mainly mediated through TNR1B, its primary biological target. Both the soluble and the transmembrane forms play a role in inflammatory responses and whilst mTNF exerts its biological function through cell-to-cell contact to moderate inflammation, sTNF, acts at sites remote from the TNF-producing cells to drive inflammation. Both protective and pathogenic, it induces cell death in response to microbial infection but behaves aberrantly when induced as a result of environmental or genetic factors, thereby driving the pathogenesis of inflammatory disorders. Cytotoxic effects mediated by mTNF include lung injury induced in the alveolar macrophages of HIV patients, yet mTNF offers protection from Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.

CPX-8932	mTNF-TNR1A receptor-ligand core complex, BIRC2 variant	A membrane-bound tumour necrosis factor-receptor signalling complex (Complex I) formed on the binding of the membrane-bound form of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, tumour necrosis factor (mTNF, CPX-8931). This activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF-kappa-B) signalling pathways, leading to proinflammatory gene expression and promoting cell survival. The Ripoptosome (CPX-1907, Complex II) originates from the dissociation of Complex I components from the receptor and promotes cell apoptosis. TNF, a key regulator of T regulatory cells, is mainly secreted by macrophages, T helper 1 and natural killer cells, while its receptor component TNFRSF1A is ubiquitously expressed on almost all human tissues. Intracellular signaling is triggered by ligand-bound receptors assembling into higher-order clusters. Soluble TNFA triggers more robust clustering of TNFR1 than membrane-bound ligand. TNFR1-mediated signaling is therefore generally caused by the activation due to sTNFA over mTNFA. TNFA-TNFRSF1A signalling complex formation is indirectly influenced by TNFA-TNFRSF1B activation and the cross-talk between the receptor complexes is central to cell-survival, proliferation or death.

CPX-8933	mTNF-TNR1B receptor-ligand core complex, BIRC2 variant	A membrane-bound tumor necrosis factor-receptor signaling complex formed on the binding of the membrane-bound form of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, tumour necrosis factor (mTNF, CPX-8931). TNFRSF1B is similar in its extracellular structure to TNFRSF1A (P19438) at the mTNF and sTNF binding sites, but it lacks the death domain found in TNFRSF1A. Instead, TNFRSF1B containss a TNF receptor associated factor (TRAF) binding site. mNF-stimulated TNFRSF1B complexes recruit TRAF2-BIRC2/3, reducing their availability for triggering MAP3K14/NIK (Q99558) degradation. As a result, NIK accumulates and drives NF-kappa-B signaling. Aggregation of the TNF-TNFR2 complexes brings two or more TRAF2-BIRC2/3 complexes into proximity, enabling BIRC2/3 transactivation of their E3 ligase activity resulting in Lys-63-ubiquitination of TRAF2. This generates docking sites for classical NF-kappa-B signaling-stimulating kinases. TNFA is a key regulator of T regulatory cells, mainly secreted by macrophages, T helper 1 and natural killer cells, and while TNFRSF1A (P19438) is ubiquitously expressed, TNFRSF1B is mainly expressed by immune cells, neurons and endothelial cells.

IL-6 plays fundamental roles in immune response, inflammation, hematopoiesis, and bone homeostasis under homeostatic conditions. Dimeric IL-6 has an increased affinity for soluble IL-6RA but are thought to have a decreased ability to bind IL6ST/gp130, and thus considered an IL-6 antagonist. Binding of the monomeric form of IL-6 to its specific IL-6RA and the signal-tranducing glycoprotein component IL6ST results in three distinct modes of IL-6-mediated signalling: classic IL-6 signalling, trans-IL-6 signalling and cluster-IL-6 signalling.

A death domain (DD) contained within the cytoplasmic tail of TNFRSF1A allows it to recruit TRADD (TNFR1-associated DD, Q15628) and its associated molecules which predominantly results in cell survival through NF-KB-NIK or MAPK activation. Apoptosis is initiated through TRADD's interaction with FADD (Q13158). LTA is produced predominantly by activated innate and adaptive immune cells, and its effects are mediated by TNFRSF1A which is expressed on most cells, including tumour cell types. TNFRSF1A signalling leads to cell death and canonical NFKB-mediated inflammatory processes, as well as the development and progression of autoimmune diseases.

CPX-8947	Lymphotoxin-alpha-beta-LTBR receptor complex	Asymmetric receptor complex which plays a broad role in thymic function including the development and maintenance of lymphoid organs as well as lymph node remodelling and the induction of IFNG (P01579) and T cell responses during systemic viral infections. The complex's effects are mediated by activating NF-KB. LTA-LTB-LTBR signalling also promotes apoptosis via TRAF3 (Q13114) and TRAF5 (O00463). Expressed by non-hematopoeitic and follicular dendritic cells, dysregulation of LTA and LTB expression on the surface on subsets of activated T and B cells and NK cells is responsible for the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases.

CPX-8962	19S proteasome regulatory complex	Functions as a proteasome regulator when bound to the barrel-shaped 20S Proteasome to form the 26S Proteasome. Recognises and deubiquitinates substrates as they enter the 20S catalytic core, thereby enabling protein degradation and maintaining cellular protein homeostasis. Abundantly found as free 19S near synapses, where there is a large demand for protein turnover. Independently regulates synaptic proteins in the absence of the 20S core proteasome. Free 19S moonlights as a deubiquitinase (DUB) by binding and deubiquitynating lysine 63-ubiquitin (Lys63-ub) a non-proteasome-targeting ubiquitin linkage in AMPARs (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor) to regulate synaptic transmission.	19S Proteasome Regulatory Particle		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:10116
CPX-8964	19S proteasome regulatory complex	The major proteasome regulator when bound to the barrel-shaped 20S Proteasome (CPX-8806) to form the 26S proteasome (single-capped, CPX-5993) or the 30S Proteasome (double-capped, CPX-9086). Recognises and deubiquitinates substrates as they enter the 20S catalytic core, thereby enabling protein degradation and maintaining cellular protein homeostasis. Abundantly found as free 19S near synapses, where there is a large demand for protein turnover. Free 19S is thought to have a moonlighting role as a deubiquitinase (DUB) and independently regulates synaptic proteins in the absence of the 20S core proteasome. The 19S regulatory particle is comprised of 19 integral subunits including six proteasome AAA-ATPases (PSMC1-6) and 13 non-ATPase subunits. PSMD2, PSMD4 and ADRM1 bind to conjugated ubiquitin tags on a protein, while the DUBs, USP14 and UCHL5 (and PSMD14 when bound to 20S) remove ubiquitin modifications and facilitate degradation of the conjugated substrate, thereby enabling the 26S proteasome to degrade substrates in a highly regulated ubiquitin-dependent manner, ensuring its role as the major activator for intracellular proteolysis.	19S Proteasome Regulatory Particle|19S Regulatory Particle|ATP-dependent activator, PA700|PA700 Proteasome activator		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606
CPX-8965	30S proteasome complex	Multi-enzyme complex that functions as the primary degradation machinery for the selective turnover of surplus or damaged proteins within the cell. Proteins targeted for degradation are covalently labelled with polyubiquitin chains which are recognized and removed by the proteasome. The core contains the protease active sites (chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like and peptidylglutamyl-peptide hydrolysing) that perform the proteolysis reactions in an internal chamber. The regulatory particles act as a discriminating gateway for potential substrates. This complex is composed of the 20S Proteasome and two 19S regulatory particles. The 19S regulatory particle (CPX-8962) is the major activator that allows the 20S Proteasome to degrade almost any protein tagged with the small protein modifier ubiquitin. The 19S recognises and deubiquitinates substrates as they enter the 20S catalytic core, thereby enabling protein degradation and maintaining cellular protein homeostasis. Attachment of the 19S to one end of the 20S forms the 26S proteasome (single-capped), and two ends, the 30S Proteasome (double-capped, this complex). While both 19S regulatory particles can engage with a protein substrate and be functional, it is thought that the proteasome function is more efficient if the opposite side to substrate entry side serves for peptide exit. Thus, concurrent functionality of both 19S particles may be mutually exclusive and the 30S Proteasome may function most efficiently as a single capped 26S Proteasome.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:10116
CPX-8967	Interleukin-6 sIL6R-mIL6ST receptor-ligand trans-signalling complex	Symmetrical 2:2:2 complex formed on the binding of interleukin-6 (IL6) to the IL6 specific alpha receptor (IL6R) and the signal transducing component, IL6ST (glycoprotein 130, gp130). IL6 binds to IL6R with low affinity but the IL6:IL6R dimer binds to IL6ST with high affinity resulting in trimer formation. A hexameric complex is formed upon the interaction between IL6 of one trimer and the D1 domain on site-3 of IL6ST of the other trimer. IL6R exists in soluble (sIL6R) and membrane bound (mIL6R) forms, and complex formation results in the induction of either a pro-inflammatory trans-signalling pathway (CPX-8967, this complex), or a classical anti-inflammatory signalling cascade (CPX-623) leading to protective and regenerative outcomes, respectively. Ligand-receptor assembly results in the formation of the complete complex, inducing the transphosphorylation of IL6ST-associated JAK1/2 and TYK2 molecules as well as phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tails of the IL6ST receptor. Phosphorylated STAT3 dissociates from the receptors, dimerize and translocate into the nucleus where they induce the transcription of IL6 target genes. IL6-induced trans- and classical signalling is indifferent in canonical intracellular JAK-STAT pathway, but trans-signalling is considered to be the more potent of the two. The ratio of mIL6R to IL6ST on a cell's surface decides how trans- and classical signalling are sensed by a cell. IL6 is a pleiotropic cytokine involved in regulating inflammatory responses as well as co-ordinating developmental, metabolic and neuronal processes. Plays an essential role in B-cell differentiation and modulation of acute-phase responses. Involved in lymphocyte and monocyte differentiation. Acts on B-cells, T-cells, hepatocytes, hematopoietic progenitor cells and cells of the CNS. Acts to increase the breakdown of fats and improve insulin resistance in its role as a myokine. Trans-signalling is considered the primary mechanism through which IL6 signalling promotes tumourigenesis in multiple cancers. Dysregulation of the IL6 signalling pathway and in particular JAK1/STAT3 activity is associated with diseases such as Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), type 2 diabetes and various cancers. The IL6/JAK/STAT3 signalling pathway is aberrantly overactive in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions and in those with haematopoietic malignancies or solid tumours, and targeting components of the IL6/JAK/STAT3 pathway has been shown to inhibit growth of tumour cells and relieve immunosuppression in the tumour microenvironment.

CPX-8968	Membrane bound interleukin-6 mIL6R receptor-ligand cluster-signalling complex	Symmetrical 2:2:2 complex formed on the binding of interleukin-6 (IL6) to the IL6 specific alpha receptor (IL6R) and the signal transducing component, IL6ST (glycoprotein 130, gp130). IL6 binds to IL6R with low affinity but the IL6:IL6R dimer binds to IL6ST with high affinity resulting in trimer formation. A hexameric complex is formed upon the interaction between IL6 of one trimer and the D1 domain on site-3 of IL6ST of the other trimer. IL6R exists in soluble (sIL6R) and membrane bound (mIL6R) forms, and complex formation results in the induction of either a pro-inflammatory trans-signalling pathway (CPX-8967), or a classical anti-inflammatory signalling cascade (CPX-623) leading to protective and regenerative outcomes, respectively. This complex (CPX-8968) is involved in cluster signalling, a third mechanism of IL6 signalling where preformed complexes of membrane-bound IL6-mIL6R on one cell (transmitting cell) activate an IL6ST receptor on another neighbouring cell (receiving cell) to initiate signal transduction. IL6 cluster signalling can be neutralized upon soluble IL6ST binding directly to the IL6-IL6R complex on a transmitting cell. Ligand-receptor assembly results in the formation of the complete complex, inducing the transphosphorylation of IL6ST-associated JAK1/2 and TYK2 molecules as well as phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tails of the IL6ST receptor. Phosphorylated STAT3 dissociates from the receptors, dimerize and translocate into the nucleus where they induce the transcription of IL6 target genes. IL6 is a pleiotropic cytokine involved in regulating inflammatory responses as well as co-ordinating developmental, metabolic and neuronal processes. Plays an essential role in B-cell differentiation and modulation of acute-phase responses. Involved in lymphocyte and monocyte differentiation. Acts on B-cells, T-cells, hepatocytes, hematopoietic progenitor cells and cells of the CNS. Cluster-signalling mediates the priming of pathogenic T-helper 17 cells. Dysregulation of the IL6 signalling pathway and in particular JAK1/STAT3 activity is associated with diseases such as Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and various cancers.

CPX-8969	Interleukin-6 sIL6R-sIL6ST buffering receptor-ligand complex	Symmetrical 2:2:2 complex formed on the binding of interleukin-6 (IL6) to the IL6 specific alpha receptor (IL6R) and the signal transducing component, IL6ST (glycoprotein 130, gp130). IL6 binds to IL6R with low affinity but the IL6:IL6R dimer binds to IL6ST with high affinity resulting in trimer formation. A hexameric complex is formed upon the interaction between IL6 of one trimer and the D1 domain on site-3 of IL6ST of the other trimer. IL6R exists in soluble (sIL6R) and membrane bound (mIL6R) forms, and complex formation results in the induction of either a pro-inflammatory trans-signalling pathway (CPX-8967), or a classical anti-inflammatory signalling cascade (CPX-623) leading to protective and regenerative outcomes, respectively. IL6ST also exists in both soluble (sIL6ST) and membrane bounds forms, but unlike sIL6R, sIL6ST antagonizes IL6 induced signalling. sIL6ST together with sIL6R constitute a buffer system, where the presence of excess sIL6R favours trans-signalling, but an excess of sIL6ST, blocks IL6 induced signalling. Ligand-receptor assembly results in the formation of the complete complex, inducing the transphosphorylation of IL6ST-associated JAK1/2 and TYK2 molecules as well as phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tails of the IL6ST receptor. Phosphorylated STAT3 dissociates from the receptors, dimerize and translocate into the nucleus where they induce the transcription of IL6 target genes.

CPX-898	Annexin A2 - S100-A10 complex	Calcium-dependent membrane-tethering complex that acts on ruptured membranes and aids general membrane organisation. Annexin A2 binds to negatively charged phospholipids at rupture sites while the S100-A10 dimer binds one molecule of annexin A2 at each end forming a junctions between adjacent bilayers. Rapid influx of Ca2+ at the rupture site activates complex formation by Ca2+ binding to Annexin A2. Membrane tethering is further aided by additional proteins forming larger complexes, such as the AHNAK - Annexin A2 - S100-A10 complex (CPX-905) or the SMARCA3 - Annexin A2 - S100-A10 complex (CPX-899); repair activity may also require dysferlin (Q9ESD7). Also plays a role in the organization of membrane-associated actin at sites of cholesterol-rich membrane domains. Found at sites of plasma membrane/secretory granule membrane contact and intergranule contact and therefore possibly involved in exocytotic processes and vesicles aggregation. Can indirectly affect a number of membrane transport events. Linked to Cl− channel regulation. As an extracellular complex, it regulates the stimulation of t-PA-dependent activation of plasminogen.

CPX-90	Mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint complex MAD2	The Spindle Assembly complex ensures accurate chromosome segregation by delaying anaphase entry by inhibiting Cdc20, the mitotic co-activator of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Mad2 adopts two distinct conformations; when unbound, it adopts an open conformation (O-Mad2) but upon binding to Mad1, the Mad2 C‐terminal tail crosses the entire surface of the beta‐sheet and locks Mad1. Upon mitotic entry, the Mad1-C-Mad2 core complex is recruited to kinetochores. Because Mad2 can dimerise, O-Mad2 from the cytosol can then be recruited to kinetochore-bound Mad1-C-Mad2. C-Mad2 within the Mad1-C-Mad2 core complex acts as a prion-like template, catalysing the conversion of additional O-Mad2 proteins to the closed conformation and in doing so binding Cdc20			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:10090
CPX-900	SAGA complex, KAT2A variant	A histone acetyltransferase transcriptional co-activator complex that preferably acetylates histone H3 and possibly H4. Acetyl-CoA-dependent and appears to require the presence of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factors to enable its coactivator activity. Recruited to the promoter region by co-operatively binding to factors such as MYC (P01106) and TP53 (P04637). Also has histone H2A and H2B deubiquitinase activity which counteracts heterochromatin silencing. Interacts with the UV-damaged DNA binding proteins DDB1 (Q16531) and DDB2 (Q92466), suggesting possible roles in transcription-coupled pre-mRNA splicing and DNA damage repair. SAGA complex has also been called STAGA complex, it is considered as the same complex in later publications (PMID:19114550, 25111486, 18206972, 15115762). The subunit composition also largely overlaps with TFTC complex (CPX-903) which has been separately described but may prove to be a different form of the same complex.

CPX-9001	PA28-gamma single-capped 20S proteasome complex	Multi-enzyme complex that functions as the primary degradation machinery for the selective turnover of surplus or damaged proteins within the cell. The core contains the protease active sites (chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like and peptidylglutamyl-peptide hydrolyzing) that perform the proteolysis reactions in an internal chamber. Regulatory particles referred to as 'caps' act as a discriminating gateway for potential substrates. This complex is formed upon the endogenous proteasomal activator, PA28, a 28 kDa protein binding to the 20S proteasome (CPX-8806). PA28 exists as three highly homologous isoforms, alpha, beta and gamma (Q06323, Q9UL46 and P61289 respectively), which differ significantly in their biochemical and biological properties. PA28-gamma is thought to be the most similar to the common PA28 ancestor and likely to have retained its original functions. PA28-gamma is prevalent in the nucleus and is integral to enhancing degradation rates in diverse cellular processes including cell growth and proliferation, apoptosis, chromatin structure and organization and response to DNA damage. PA28-gamma binds in an ubiquitin- and ATP-independent manner to either one (single-cap, this complex) or both ends (double-capped, CPX-9022) of the 20S Proteasome, but the efficiency of substrate processing by single and double-capped proteasomes in not known. Binding of the activator modifies the 20S peptidase and opens its outer alpha-ring gates allowing substrate entry to the antechamber. PA28-gamma also modifies the proteolytic activities of the 20S Proteasome. Complex regulates protein degradation either in a regulated manner upon specific molecular cues or acts on damaged and disordered proteins. Plays a key role under oxidative stress conditions to degrade damaged and unfolded proteins. Promotes proteasomal degradation of several important regulatory proteins including SRC-3 and the tumour suppressor p53, as well as growth-related proteins such as the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21, p19 and p16 and c-Myc. PA28-gamma subunit is a key regulator of cell growth and proliferation and apoptosis. Dysregulation of PA28-gamma results in induction of malignant tumours in several cancers. PA28-gamma promotes the degradation of multiple proteins including p53 via MDM2-mediated interaction but over-expression of PA28-gamma leads to carcinogenesis through its ability to modulate the Wnt/b-catenin pathway. PA28-gamma in association with PA200, plays a key role in male fertility by their ability to regulate sperm motility.	11S regulator gamma - 20S complex|Multicatalytic protease activator - 20S Proteasome complex|PA28-20S complex|Proteasome activator 28 - 20S Proteasome complex|Proteasome activator 28 gamma - 20S Proteasome complex|Reg-gamma - 20S complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606

The three subunits differ significantly in their biochemical and biological properties. PA28-alpha and PA28-beta favour the release of peptide products by the proteasome and are specifically involved in optimizing MHC class 1 antigen presentation. PA28-alpha and PA28-beta bind in an ATP-independent manner to either one (single-cap, this complex) or both ends (double-capped, CPX-8842) of the of the 20S proteasome, but the efficiency of substrate processing by single and double-capped proteasomes in not known. Binding of the activator modifies the 20S peptidase and opens its outer alpha-ring gates allowing substrate entry to the antechamber through an internal activation loop. Regulates protein degradation either in a regulated manner upon specific molecular cues or acts on damaged and disordered proteins. Plays a key role under oxidative stress conditions to degrade damaged and unfolded proteins and is up-regulated by interferon-gamma during antigen presentation. Tumorigenesis of PA28-alpha is unclear but up-regulation of the subunit is associated with several cancers, including ovarian, prostate and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), and interestingly, silencing it suppressed OSCC cell growth and metastasis.	11S regulator - 20S complex|Multicatalytic protease activator - 20S Proteasome complex|PA28-20S complex|Proteasome activator 28 - 20S Proteasome complex|Proteasome activator 28 alpha-beta - 20S Proteasome complex|Reg-alpha-Reg-beta 20S complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606
CPX-9003	20S immunoproteasome complex	Multi-enzyme complex that functions as the primary degradation machinery for the selective turnover of surplus or damaged proteins within the cell. Found only in jawed vertebrates, formed upon exposure to inflammatory stimuli such as interferon-gamma (IFN-g) or tumour necrosis factor, the proteolytic activity of the 20S immunoproteasome (20Si) differs from its standard 20S (CPX-8806) counterpart with the constitutive subunits beta-1 (P28072), beta-2 (Q99436), and beta-5 (P28074) replaced by its immune counterparts beta-1i (P28065), beta-2i (P40306), and beta-5i (P28062), respectively. Constitutively expressed in lymphoid tissues at high levels but requires induction by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-g in non-lymphoid tissues. Has lower caspase-like activity than the standard 20S Proteasome but a higher chymotrypsin-like and trypsin-like activity, resulting in alternative cleavage of proteins, to generate peptides with hydrophobic or basic C-termini, which are preferred by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I. Expressed by medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs), which contribute to the establishment of self-tolerance in T cells. Implicated in proteasome-mediated generation of CD8+ T cell epitopes thereby expanding the diversity of the epitopes presented by MHC class I molecules through a mechanism known as PCPS (proteasome-catalyzed peptide splicing), with up to one-third of self-peptides presented on the cell surface generated by PCPS . Plays a role in macrophage activation and T-cell differentiation, as well as the differentiation of non-immune cells like skeletal muscle cells, and the preservation of general homeostasis. Implicated in disorders such as cancer, neurodegerative and autoimmune diseases. Immunoproteasome-specific inhibitors targeting beta-5i have demonstrated some success at the pre-clinical stage for the treatment of diseases such as colitis, colitis-associated cancer and rheumatoid arthritis.	20Si Proteasome - LMP2, MECL1, LMP7 complex|20Si Proteasome - b1i, b2i, b5i complex|Immunoproteasome		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606
CPX-9004	20S thymoproteasome complex	Multi-enzyme complex that functions as the primary degradation machinery for the selective turnover of surplus or damaged proteins within the cell. An immune-type proteasome expressed exclusively and constitutively expressed in the cortex of the thymus by cortical thymic epithelial cells (cTECs). The beta-5i (P28062) subunit is replaced by the cTEC-specific beta-5t (A5LHX3) subunit along with beta-1i (P28065) and beta-2i (P40306) subunits.. The thymoproteasome is essential for the optimal production and repertoire formation of CD8+ cells, and their homeostasis. Thymoproteasome-generated self-peptides associated with MHC class I molecules expressed by cTECs are thought to contribute to this positive selection of CD8+ cells. Specific to the thymoproteasome, the beta-5t subunit is a useful diagnostic marker in tracking disease progression of certain thymic epthelial tumours.

CPX-9021	20S spermatoproteasome complex	Multi-enzyme complex that functions as the primary degradation machinery for the selective turnover of surplus or damaged proteins within the cell. Specifically found in the testis, spermatoproteasomes (s20S) are comprised of the constitutive 20S Proteasome subunits (alpha 1-3 and 5-6 and beta 1-7), as well as a novel alpha-4s subunit (Q8TAA3) in lieu of the alpha-4 subunit (O14818). The s20S associates with proteasomal activators to form large (19S-s20S-PA200, hybrid) and small s20S-PA200 (single-capped), PA200-s20S-PA200 (double-capped) spermatoproteasomal complexes. Mammalian s20S are known to degrade acetylated histones through association with PA200 (Q14997) and play a role in DNA damage repair in spermatocytes and the maturation of spermatids. Promotes acetylation-dependent degradation of histones through PA200's BRDL (bromodomain like) region, thereby participating actively in the exchange of histones during spermatogenesis. Essential for the degradation of meiotic proteins RAD51 and RPA1 at late prophase I and the progression of meiosis I during spermatogenesis. Localizes to the synaptonemal complex, a 'zipper-like' structure that holds homologous chromosome pairs in synapsis during meiotic prophase I. Loss of PA200 in mouse models revealed defects in spermatogenesis in meiotic spermatocytes as well as during postmeiotic haploid spermatids maturation, with a marked reduction in male fertility.

Plays a key role under oxidative stress conditions to degrade damaged and unfolded proteins. Promotes proteasomal degradation of several important regulatory proteins including SRC-3 and the tumour suppressor p53, as well as growth-related proteins such as the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21, p19 and p16 and c-Myc. PA28-gamma subunit is a key regulator of cell growth and proliferation and apoptosis. Dysregulation of PA28-gamma results in induction of malignant tumours in several cancers. PA28-gamma promotes the degradation of multiple proteins including p53 via MDM2-mediated interaction but over-expression of PA28-gamma leads to carcinogenesis through its ability to modulate the Wnt/b-catenin pathway. PA28-gamma in association with PA200, plays a key role in male fertility by their ability to regulate sperm motility.	11S regulator gamma - 20S complex|Multicatalytic protease activator - 20S Proteasome complex|PA28-20S complex|Proteasome activator 28 - 20S Proteasome complex|Proteasome activator 28 gamma - 20S Proteasome complex|Reg-gamma - 20S complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606
CPX-903	TFTC histone acetylation complex	A chromatin-acetylating transcription coactivator with histone acetyltransferase activity. TFTC is a TBP (TATA binding protein) independent transcription initiation factor, able to nucleate RNA polymerase II transcription. It acetylates histone H3 in both a free and a nucleosomal context, but preferentially in nucleosomes assembled on UV-irradiated DNA, indicating that TFTC may also function as a facilitator of DNA repair. It interacts with the splicing factor SF3B3 (Q15393). The complex also has histone H2A and H2B deubiquitinase activity which counteracts heterochromatin silencing. May include TAF6L (Q9Y6J9). Because of the similar subunit composition between the TFTC complex and the SAGA (also called STAGA) complex, it has been considered as the same complex in some publications (PMID:19114550, 25111486, 18206972, 15115762).

CPX-9061	Mitochondrial 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex	Catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of alpha-ketoglutarate to succinyl-CoA, NADH and CO2 in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. 2-oxoglutarate is decarboxylated by the thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP)-containing E1 OGDH and the resulting 2-succinyl intermediate is transferred to the flexible lipoyl domain of E2 DLST. DLST transfers the succinyl functional group from its lipoyl domain onto CoA-SH generating succinyl-CoA. In a final reaction, the lipoyl domain of DLST is re-oxidized by E3 DLD, a FAD-containing subunit that transfers electrons to NAD+ producing NADH Succinyl-CoA is then converted to succinate by succinyl-CoA synthetase. The enzyme complex thus generates metabolites and reduced electron carriers for oxidative phosphorylation.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606

CPX-9063	PA200-20S-PA200 double-capped proteasome complex	Multi-enzyme complex that functions as the primary degradation machinery for the selective turnover of surplus or damaged proteins within the cell. The core contains the protease active sites (chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like and peptidylglutamyl-peptide hydrolyzing) that perform the proteolysis reactions in an internal chamber. Regulatory particles referred to as 'caps' act as a discriminating gateway for potential substrates. This complex is formed upon a 200 kDa proteasome activator (PA200) binding either symmetrically or asymmetrically to the alpha-rings of the multicatalytic constitutive cylindrical 20S core complex (CPX-8806), composed of four heteroheptameric rings, of which the outer two are composed of alpha subunits (1-7) and the inner two of beta subunits (1-7). PA200 binds in an ubiquitin- and ATP-independent manner to either one (single-cap, CPX-8841) or both ends (double-capped, this complex) of the 20S Proteasome, but the efficiency of substrate processing by single and double-capped proteasomes in not known. A nuclear-localized proteasomal regulator, PA200 enhances the 20S proteasome's ability to degrade short peptides, disordered proteins, and PA200-bound inositol phosphates act on acetylated core (AC) histones during DNA repair and replication stress in an ubiquitin-independent manner. Also implicated in mitochondrial fission, turnover of ribosome-related transcription factor Sfp1 and maintaining intracellular glutamine levels. Thought not essential for DNA repair, the PA200 component is more sensitive to DNA damage and PA200-hybrid proteasomes are known to form in response to ionizing radiation. PA200 is also thought to work with PA28-gamma to regulate male fertility. External stimuli and diseases can change a proteasome's composition, thereby affecting the proteasome's substrate specificity and consequently protein homeostasis within a cell. Decreased proteasome activity is linked to neurodegerative disorders and cardiac dysfunction through the accumulation of proteins while, enhanced proteasome activity and induced-expression of certain proteasome components are implicated in muscle wasting conditions and several cancers. PA200 in association with PA28-gamma, plays a key role in male fertility by their ability to regulate sperm motility.	PA200-20S-PA200 Proteasome		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606

CPX-9082	19S-20S-PA28-alphabeta hybrid proteasome complex	Multi-enzyme complex that functions as the primary degradation machinery for the selective turnover of surplus or damaged proteins within the cell. Proteins targeted for degradation are covalently labelled with polyubiquitin chains which are recognized and removed by the proteasome. The core contains the protease active sites (chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like and peptidylglutamyl-peptide hydrolysing) that perform the proteolysis reactions in an internal chamber. Regulatory particles referred to as 'caps' act as a discriminating gateway for potential substrates. Formed upon induction by IFN-gamma, this double-capped hybrid proteasome complex comprises the proteasome regulator PA28alpha-beta (PSME1-Q06323, PSME2-Q9UL46) at one end of the 20S catalytic core (CPX-8806), and the 19S regulatory particle (CPX-8964) at the other end. Protein degradation is directed in an ubiquitin and ATP-dependent manner by the 19S cap, while the PA28alpha-beta cap acts through an ATP and ubiquitin independent pathway. The 19S cap is thought to determine the rate of protein hydrolysis, while the PA28alpha-beta cap is thought to allosterically modify the 20S core's active sites to increase production of suitable peptides for MHC class 1 presentation. In contrast to PA28alphabeta-20S proteasome, the 19S-20S-PA28alpha-beta hybrid proteasome generates an altered pattern of cleavage products, without altering the mean peptide length.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606

The core contains the protease active sites (chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like and peptidylglutamyl-peptide hydrolysing) that perform the proteolysis reactions in an internal chamber. Regulatory particles referred to as 'caps' act as a discriminating gateway for potential substrates. This double-capped hybrid proteasome complex comprises the proteasome regulator PA28gamma (PSME3-P61289) at one end of the 20S catalytic core (CPX-8806), and the 19S regulatory particle (CPX-8964) at the other end.

CPX-9086	30S proteasome complex	Multi-enzyme complex that functions as the primary degradation machinery for the selective turnover of surplus or damaged proteins within the cell. Proteins targeted for degradation are covalently labelled with polyubiquitin chains which are recognized and removed by the proteasome. The core contains the protease active sites (chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like and peptidylglutamyl-peptide hydrolysing) that perform the proteolysis reactions in an internal chamber. The regulatory particles act as a discriminating gateway for potential substrates. This complex is composed of the 20S Proteasome (CPX-8806) and two 19S regulatory particles. The 19S regulatory particle (CPX-8964) is the major activator that allows the 20S Proteasome to degrade almost any protein tagged with the small protein modifier ubiquitin. The 19S recognises and deubiquitinates substrates as they enter the 20S catalytic core, thereby enabling protein degradation and maintaining cellular protein homeostasis. Attachment of the 19S to one end of the 20S forms the 26S proteasome (single-capped, CPX-5993), and two ends, the 30S Proteasome (double-capped, this complex). While both 19S regulatory particles can engage with a protein substrate and be functional, it is thought that the proteasome function is more efficient if the opposite side to substrate entry side serves for peptide exit. Thus, concurrent functionality of both 19S particles may be mutually exclusive and the 30S Proteasome may function most efficiently as a single capped 26S Proteasome. Dysregulated proteasome function has been implicated, as a primary cause or a secondary consequence, in the pathogenesis of a broad array of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s diseases.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606

CPX-909	NLGN1(-SSA-SSB) - NRXN1-beta(-SS4) complex	A cell adhesion complex that forms at synaptic clefts and mediates trans-synaptic signaling. Composed by binding of the extracellular domains of two presynaptic neurexin proteins and two postsynaptic neuroligin proteins. Expression of both subunits is regulated by neuronal activity. Required for synaptic differentiation, maturation and maintenance, dendritic spine remodelling and axon arborisation. Possibly required for synapse formation. Mediates bidirectional synaptic signalling and coupling of presynaptic, Ca2+-dependent synaptic vesicle exocytosis (= neurotransmitter release) with postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor recruitment. Acts as a molecular switch between excitatory and inhibitory synapses: this complex acts primarily, but not exclusively, on GABAergic, inhibitory synapses that mainly release neurotransmitters GABA and glycine. Mainly found in synaptic clefts of the central nervous system but also at neuromuscular junctions (particularly alpha neurexin-containing complexes). Mutations in the neuroligin dimer interface as well as allosteric affects of mutation in both subunits affect spacial and fear-associated memory and result in autism-related disorders, mental retardation disorders and schizophrenia.

CPX-9102	Interleukin-7 mIL7R-IL2RG receptor-ligand signalling complex	Transmembrane complex formed on the binding of extracellular interleukin-7 (IL7) to its high-affinity receptor, IL7R and the shared IL2RG. Ligand binding results in the assembly of the complete complex, inducing the transphosphorylation of JAK1/JAK3 molecules as well as phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tails of the receptors. STAT5 (P42229) monomers then bind to the phosphorylated site of the receptor and are phosphorylated by JAK1, while PIK3R associated with survival signalling, interacts with JAK3. Phosphorylated STATs dissociates from the receptors, dimerize and translocate into the nucleus where they induce the transcription of target genes. IL7 is a key regulator of immune homeostasis, critical for B cell development, and IL7 signalling is essential for the proliferation and survival of memory and naive T cells, as well as T cell development in the thymus. A potent immunomodulator of tumours, it has both the ability to eradicate tumours but also exert strong pro-tumour effects. There are two major isoforms of IL7R, the membrane-bound IL7R (mIL7R, P16871-1) and an alternatively spliced soluble IL7R (sIL7R, P16871-4) lacking the transmembrane region encoding exon 6 (CPX-493). Competition between mIL7R and sIL7R, which binds IL7 with greater affinity, diminishes STAT5 phosphorylation and therefore excessive signalling but increases overall bioavailability of the limited resource IL7. IL7 signalling contributes to autoimmunity and has been implicated as a cofactor in multiple sclerosis, autoimmune-related colitis, diabetes and lupus. IL7R associated insertion/deletion mutations have been linked to Philadelphia chromosome-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-like ALL), a high-risk sub-type of B-ALL, as well as T-ALL.

CPX-9126	Interleukin-1 antagonist complex	Complex formed on the binding of the interleukin-1 receptor (IL1R1) to the interleukin-1 receptor agonist (IL1RA). IL1RA competitively binds to the IL1R1 with a high affinity thereby preventing it binding to IL1A (P01583) and IL1B (P01584), resulting in the non-recruitment of the accessory protein subunit responsible for signalling, IL1RAP (Q9NPH3) and abrogation of signal transduction. Overproduction of IL1B and IL1A and the consequent up-regulation of IL1R1 are responsible for driving various chronic inflammatory and auto-immune disorders. Therapeutic approaches have targeted IL1 neutralization through antagonists or by inhibiting IL1 signalling.

CPX-9128	Interleukin-1 beta ligand-soluble receptor type 1 complex	Complex formed on the binding of a pre-bound extracellular interleukin-1 beta (IL1B) and a soluble form of its receptor, interleukin-1R1 (IL1R1) to its coreceptor, interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP). Recruitment of IL1RAP completes complex assembly and initiates activation of the NFKB signalling pathway. A member of the IL1 family of cytokines, IL1B is closely related to interleukin-1 alpha (IL1A, P01583) carrying out similar biological functions by binding to their shared receptor complex. Although both IL1A and IL1B function via the same IL1R1 to drive an inflammatory response, IL1A is thought to act as an alarmin which regulates local inflammation while IL1B acts as a master regulator of systemic inflammation. IL1B is an inducible cytokine produced mainly by blood myeloid cells, pathogenic lymphocytes and the central nervous system's (CNS) microglia and astroyctes during autoimmune, metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders. IL1 activity is regulated by two forms of the IL1R1: a membrane-bound form (mIL1R1, CPX-527) and a soluble form (sIL1R1, this complex) created through proteolytic release of the ectodomain (ECD) of mIL1R1 by matrix metalloproteases. The ECD in both forms is vital for ligand recognition and binding. Both forms of IL1R1 are biologically active, mediating an inflammatory response through agonistic and antagonistic regulation of cytokine activity.

Ubiquitinylates DELE1 (Q14154) a sensor of mitochondrial import stress, and EIF2AK1 (Q9BQI3), a kinase involved in the integrated stress response promoting the degradation of these proteins that actively mediate the cellular response to mitochondrial import stress.	SIFI complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606
CPX-915	General transcription factor complex TFIID	General transcription factor complex that acts as the primary core promoter recognition factor in the initiation of RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-dependent transcription. The TBP subunit of TFIID recognizes and binds to the TATA box (if present), while TAF1 and TAF2 interact with the Initiator element (Inr), and TAF1 and the TAF6-TAF9 module recognizes the downstream core promoter element (DPE). Other core promoter elements, such as the motif ten element (MTE), may also be involved. Binding of the general transcription factor complex TFIIA (CPX-519) enhances binding of TFIID to the core promoter and nucleates pre-initiation complex (PIC) assembly. Following recruitment of TFIIA to TFIID, TFIIB, TFIIF (CPX-79), Pol II, TFIIE and TFIIH are successively assembled at the core promoter, allowing the PIC to initiate Pol II transcription. While TFIID is essential for transcription and its post-mitotic reinitiation, the loss of one or more subunits does not harm ongoing transcription during any given cell cycle. TFIID promoter binding appears to be regulated by histone modifications: TAF1 bromodomains (1361-1617 aa, IPR001487) bind the modified histone tails of acetylated H4K16, H4K5/K12 and H4K8/K16. TAF1 also appears to exhibit histone acetyltransferase activity towards histones H3 and H4. TAF3 and the PHD domains of other TFIID subunits bind modified histone tails carrying trimethylated H3K4 in combination with acetylated H3K9 and H3K14. TAF1 phosphorylates TP53 (P04637) on Thr-55, leading to TP53 degradation and G1 cell cycle progression. Spermatocytes contain variants of TAF-containing complexes, including the TAF4B variant (CPX-930).	Transcription factor complex IID		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606
CPX-916	TFTC histone acetylation complex	A chromatin-acetylating transcription coactivator with histone acetyltransferase activity. TFTC is a TBP (TATA binding protein) independent transcription initiation factor, able to nucleate RNA polymerase II transcription. It acetylates histone H3 in both a free and a nucleosomal context, but preferentially in nucleosomes assembled on UV-irradiated DNA, indicating that TFTC may also function as a facilitator of DNA repair. It interacts with the splicing factor Sf3b3 (Q921M3). The complex also has histone H2A and H2B deubiquitinase activity which counteracts heterochromatin silencing. May include TAF6L (Q8R2K4). Because of the similar subunit composition between the TFTC complex and the SAGA (also called STAGA) complex, it has been considered as the same complex in some publications (PMID:19114550, 25111486, 18206972, 15115762).

Also plays a central role in sperm chemotaxis, and mediates the Ca2+ influx induced by the steroid sex hormone progesterone in human sperm. Defective CatSper function affects migration, possibly preventing sperm reaching the site of fertilization, thereby displaying an infertility phenotype in mice and humans.

CPX-9166	Precursor interleukin-1 alpha-soluble receptor type 1 complex	Complex formed on the binding of a pre-bound precursor form of interleukin-1 alpha (IL1A) and a soluble form of its receptor, interleukin-1R1 (IL1R1) to its coreceptor, interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP). A member of the IL1 family of cytokines, IL1A is closely related to interleukin-1 beta (IL1B, P01584) carrying out similar biological functions by binding to their shared receptor complex. Although both IL1A and IL1B function via the same IL1R1 to drive an inflammatory response, IL1A acts as an alarmin and is thought to focus its efforts on local inflammation while IL1B acts as a master regulator of systemic inflammation. IL1A precursor protein (ProIL1A) is constitutively expressed by many cell types and is released upon necrotic cell death as a bioactive mediator, making it central to the pathogenesis of all conditions characterized by organ or tissue inflammation where the epitheilal barrier is disrupted. ProIL1A (this complex) is processed by calpain II (P17655) to produce the more biologically active, secreted form. IL1A activity is regulated by two forms of the IL1R1: a membrane-bound form (mIL1R1, CPX-9169) and a soluble form (sIL1R1, this complex) created through proteolytic release of the ectodomain (ECD) of mIL1R1 by matrix metalloproteases. Both forms of IL1R1 are biologically active and the ECD in both forms is vital for ligand recognition and binding.

CPX-9168	Interleukin-1 alpha decoy receptor-ligand type 2 complex	A decoy receptor complex which acts by competitively binding both IL1A and IL1RAP with high affinity, preventing their binding to IL1R1 thus inhibiting IL1 induced inflammation IL1R2 binding to precursor IL1A prevents calpain cleavage. Non-signaling IL1R2 is the predominant IL1 binding receptor expressed by monocytes, neutrophils and B cells. Regulatory T-cells also express membrane-bound and soluble IL1R2 (sIL1R2) but pro-inflammatory molecules are thought to inhibit IL1R2 expression. Plasma of healthy individuals are thought to contain high levels of sIL1R2, while defective or increased expression sIL1R2 in tissue or bodily fluids are ascribed to a range of pathological conditions, including critical autoimmune diseases, tumours and neuroinflammatory diseases.

Recruitment of IL1RAP completes complex assembly and initiates activation of the NFKB signalling pathway. A member of the IL1 family of cytokines, IL1A is closely related to interleukin-1 beta (IL1B, P01584) carrying out similar biological functions by binding to their shared receptor complex. Although both IL1A and IL1B function via the same IL1R1 to drive an inflammatory response, IL1A acts as an alarmin which regulates local inflammation while IL1B acts as a master regulator of systemic inflammation. IL1A is synthesized as a precursor protein which is processed by calpain II (P17655) to produce a more active, mature form. IL1A activity is regulated by two forms of the IL1R1: a membrane-bound form (mIL1R1, this complex) and a soluble form (sIL1R1) created through proteolytic release of the ectodomain (ECD) of mIL1R1 via matrix metalloproteases. The ECD in both forms is vital for ligand recognition and binding. Both forms of IL1A and IL1R1 are biologically active, mediating an inflammatory response through agonistic and antagonistic regulation of cytokine activity.

CPX-9181	SESAME metabolic enzyme complex	Multi-enzyme complex which regulates the crosstalk between Histone H3 (HHt1/HHT2, P61830) methylation and phosphorylation by sensing glycolysis and glucose-derived serine metabolism. This leads to auto-regulation of the expression of the PYK1 pyruvate kinase. Complex activity is stimulated by glycolysis and serine metabolism to repress gene expression and confer cell resistance to oxidative stress. In the presence of sufficient glucose, PYK1 is activated, and SET1 (P38827) is recruited at the promoter of PYK1 by active RNA polymerase II. PYK1 phosphorylates Thr-12 of histone H3 using phosphoenolpyruvate as a substrate, while serine biosynthetic enzymes in SESAME generate serine from 3-phosphoglyceric acid to stimulate this phosphorylation. The COMPASS complex (CPX-1039) then recruits SESAME to the PYK1 coding region, allowing COMPASS to utilize SAM synthesized by SESAME to methylate H3 Lys-5. This interaction with COMPASS promotes SESAME recruitment, which phosphorylates H3 Thr-12 at the gene body and suppresses PYK1 transcription. The acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase ACS2 is required for the regulation of telomere silencing and cellular senescence. SESAME interacts with the SAS histone acetyltransferase complex (CPX-777) to promote histone H4 (HHF1/ HHF2) Lys-17 acetylation and the occupancy of the transcription factor , BDF1 (P35817), at subtelomeric regions. This interaction maintains telomere silencing by antagonizing the spreading of SIR2 (P06700) histone deacetylase along the telomeres, which is enhanced by acetate.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:559292
CPX-9182	SPATA5-SPATA5L1 ATPase complex	Acts as an ubiquitin-independent unfoldase, remodeling protein complexes and facilitating their subsequent cleavage by cysteine proteases and their subsequent removal from the chromatin. Processes replisome substrates in response to replication fork damage. Deficiency of the complex induces ubiquitin-independent proteotoxicity, replication stress and acute chromosome instability. Neurodevelopmental syndromes including epilepsy, hearing loss, mental retardation syndrome (EHLMRS) and neurodevelopmental disorder with hearing loss and spasticity (NEDHLS) are associated with SPATA5 and SPATA5L1 mutations.	55LCC complex|AFG2A-AFG2B DNA binding complex|Replisome proteostasis complex|SPATA5-SPATA5L1-C1orf109-CINP complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606
CPX-9184	Chitinase 3-like-1-tmem219-interleukin-13 receptor-ligand alpha-2 signalling complex	Complex formed upon Chitinase-3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1) binding to interleukin-13 receptor alpha-2 (IL13RA2) by associating with TMEM219 which is a cell-death receptor for IGFBP-3 (P17936). CHI3L1 interaction with IL13RA2 through a TMEM219-dependent pathway prevents cell death by activating the MAP kinases, ERK1/2 and AKT pathways, while direct interaction with IL13RA2 results in apoptosis through activation of Wnt/beta-catenin (P35222). Functional effects of this complex is also moderated by LGALS3 (P17931), which physically interacts with IL13RA2 and CHI3L1 to compete with TMEM219 for IL13RA2 binding, thereby diminishing the anti-apoptotic role of CHI3L1. IL13RA2 also forms a complex with IL13 and TMEM219 (CPX847) which largely acts as a decoy to diminish IL13 activity. IL13RA2 N-glycosylation is a critical determinant of whether it binds CHI3L1 or IL13; CHI3L1 binding to IL13RA2 and signalling is increased if IL13RA2 N-glycosylation is diminished. CHI3L1 is a carbohydrate-binding lectin with a preference for chitin, produced by immune cells, osteoclasts, chondrocytes, smooth muscle cells, astrocytes and cancer cells upon stimulation from several interleukins including IL13, IL6, IL1B and TNF. CHI3L1 expression is inhibited by miR-24, miR-342-3p, miR-449a, miR125a-3p and miR-96-5p. CHI3L1 binding to IL13RA2 leads to inflammasome activation, melanoma metastasis, apoptosis, oxidative damage, allergic inflammation, wound healing, fibrosis, and TGFB1 production. CH3L1 also plays a key role in antipathogenic responses and is involved in stimulating disease tolerance by controlling cell death, inflammation and remodelling.

CPX-920	SAGA complex, KAT2A variant	A transcriptional co-activator complex that preferably acetylates histone H3 and possibly H4. Acetyl-CoA-dependent and appears to require the presence of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factors to enable its coactivator activity. Recruited to the promoter region by co-operatively binding to factors such as Myc (P01108) and Tp53 (P02340). Also has histone H2A and H2B deubiquitinase activity which counteracts heterochromatin silencing. Interacts with the UV-damaged DNA binding proteins Ddb1 (Q3U1J4) and Ddb2 (Q99J79), suggesting possible roles in transcription-coupled pre-mRNA splicing and DNA damage repair. SAGA complex has also been called STAGA complex, it is considered as the same complex in later publications (PMID:19114550, 25111486, 18206972, 15115762). The subunit composition also largely overlaps with TFTC complex (CPX-916) which has been separately described but may prove to be a different form of the same complex.

Expressed by CD4+ type 17 helper cells and Tc17 cells, IL17 is also produced by several innate immune cells. IL17RA is the common subunit for all of the IL17 receptors and IL17A signalling is moderated by the restricted expression of IL17RC to non-hematopoietic epithelial and mesenchymal cells. Unrestrained IL17 signalling is associated with autoimmune diseases and cancer progression, but it is also crucial for protection from fungal and bacterial infections, including the commensal Candida albicans and Klebsiella pneumoniae. IL17 is also thought to play a dominant protective role in maintaining intestinal barrier integrity. Among the IL17 family of cytokines, IL17A is the main cytokine associated with the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases including psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus and multiple sclerosis.

Expressed by CD4+ type 17 helper cells and Tc17 cells, IL17 is also produced by several innate immune cells. IL25 binds only to IL17RB but requires the IL17RA:IL17RB receptor complex to mediate its effects. Unrestrained IL17 signalling is associated with autoimmune diseases and cancer progression, but it is also crucial for protection from fungal and bacterial infections, including the commensal Candida albicans and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Both IL25 and IL17B promote IL33-driven (O95760) type 2 immune responses, but perform contradictory roles in colitis; IL25 is pathogenic and IL17B is protective. IL17B is thought to inhibit IL25 binding to IL17RA:IL17RB expressed on epithelial cells thereby limiting IL25 induced IL6 (P05231) production by colonic epithelial cells.

IL17RA is the common subunit for all of the IL17 receptors and IL17B signalling is moderated by the restricted expression of IL17RB to various endocrine and mucosal tissues and epithelial cells. Unrestrained IL17 signalling is associated with autoimmune diseases and cancer progression, but it is also crucial for protection from fungal and bacterial infections, including the commensal Candida albicans and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Both IL17B and IL25 promote IL33-driven (O95760) type 2 immune responses, but perform contradictory roles in colitis; IL-25 is pathogenic and IL17B is protective. IL17B is thought to inhibit IL25 binding to IL17RA:IL17RB expressed on epithelial cells thereby limiting IL25 induced IL6 production by colonic epithelial cells. Heightened IL17B and IL17RB expression are associated with poor prognosis for several cancers including breast and pancreatic cancers.

CPX-9207	Interleukin-17C receptor-ligand complex	Pro-inflammatory cytokine receptor which plays a key role in both adaptive and innate immunity. TRAF3IP2 polyubiquitinates TRAF6 (Q9Y4K3) leading to the recruitment of downstream molecules and the activation of NF-KB and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. IL17C-IL17RE signalling also activates anti-apoptotic pathways via BCL2(P10415) and BCL2L1 (Q07817). While the prototypic IL17A is preferentially produced by immune cells, IL17C is predominantly produced by non-immune cells and its production is up-regulated in epethelial cells at an early stage in several diseases. IL17C mediates its effects through the IL17RA:IL17RE expressed by both epithelial and CD4+ type 17 helper cells. Unrestrained IL17C signalling is associated with autoimmune diseases and cancer progression, but it is also crucial for protection from fungal and bacterial infections such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. IL17C is induced under hypoxic and hyperglycemic conditions and is thought to drive a pathogenic inflammatory response in kidney disease. IL17C may also be involved in the development of atherosclerosis, COPD and cystic fibrosis.

CPX-922	MBD3/NuRD nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase complex	Corepressor complex that couples histone deacetylase and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling activities. It regulates the higher-order structure of chromatin, making chromatin more compact by removing acetyl groups from nucleosomes, and has important roles in the regulation of gene expression, DNA damage repair and cell differentiation. The core of the complex is composed of six groups of proteins, each one with several paralogues (HDAC1/2, MTA1/2/3, RBBP4/7, GATAD2A/B, MBD3, and CHD3/4). Combinatorial assembly of these isoforms contributes to the targeting and function of the complex. It is currently not known whether GATAD2A/GATAD2B, RBBP4/RBBP7, and MTA1/MTA2/MTA3 form heterodimers/trimers or mutually exclusive homodimers/trimers. The CHD3/4 ATPase, utilizes energy derived from hydrolysis of ATP for DNA sliding and repositioning of nucleosomes. The second catalytic subunit, HDAC1/2 (histone deacetylase), deacetylates acetylated lysine residues of histone and non-histone proteins. This dual enzymatic activity is proposed to be important for the efficient formation of heterochromatin with densely packed hypoacetylated nucleosomes and the rapid termination of gene transcription. In addition to the well-described core subunits, a large number of proteins have been reported to interact with the NuRD complex, like DOC1 (O14519), KPNA2 (P52292), ZMYND8(Q9ULU4), ZNF512B/532/592/687(Q96KM6, Q9HCE3, Q92610, Q8N1G0), SALL4 (Q9UJQ4), PRMT5 (O14744), MEP50 (Q9BQA1).

CPX-9221	Lymphotoxin-alpha-TNFRSF1B receptor complex	Receptor complex whose primary role is in lymphoid organ development, organization and the maintenance of lymphoid microenvironments to promote host defense, and inflammation. LTA mediates its effects through one of three receptors: TNFRSF1A (CPX-8945), TNFRSF1B (this complex) or TNFRSF14 (CPX-9222). TNFRSF1B lacks the death domain and is a prototypical TNFRSF receptor with a TRAF2 (Q12933) binding site at its C-terminal. Signalling can lead to apoptosis but preferentially results in cell proliferation and survival via NF-KB-NIK activation. LTA is produced by activated innate and adaptive immune cells and its effects are mediated through TNFRSF1B which is expressed on almost most cells, including tumour cell types.

Little is known about LTA's effects through TNFRSF14 as their interaction is thought to be weak. LTA also mediates its effects through two other receptors: TNFRSF1A (CPX-8945) and TNFRSF1B (CPX-9221).

CPX-9223	TNFSF14-TNFRSF14 receptor complex	Receptor complex which coordinates innate and adaptive immune responses. TNFSF14 mediated signalling through TNFRSF14 provides a costimulatory signal for T and B cell activation, and in particular signalling through the TRAF2-cIAP complex (Q12933,Q13489) which initiates the NF-KB-RelA (Q04206) led transcription of genes important for inflammatory, proliferative, and survival functions. TNFSF14 also mediates its effects through LTBR (CPX-9310), and the decoy receptor TNFRSF6B (CPX-9309). Potent modulator of T-cell driven inflammatory responses but its effects are negatively modulated by herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 virion glycoprotein D (gD); HSV1 gD inhibits the interaction of TNFRSF14 with TNFSF14, and TNFSF14 and HSV1 gD interfere with TNFRSF14-dependent cell entry by HSV1. Elevated levels of TNFSF14 is associated with the pathogenesis of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders such as asthma and IBD. TNFSF14 expression is a prognostic biomarker for COVID-19 through its ability to instigate ARDS.	HVEML-HVEM complex|LIGHT-HVEA complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606
CPX-9224	Interleukin-3 receptor-ligand complex	Transmembrane complex formed on the binding of a monomeric extracellular interleukin-3 (IL3) to its receptor composed of IL3A and CSF2RB. Ligand binding results in the assembly of the complete complex, inducing the transphosphorylation of JAK2 molecules as well as phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tails of the receptors. STAT5 monomers bind to the phosphorylated site of the receptor and are phosphorylated by JAK2. Phosphorylated STAT5 dissociates from the receptors, dimerizes, and the dimer translocates into the nucleus where it induces the transcription of target genes. IL3 can also mediate its signal through the c-myc and Ras pathways. The pleiotropic cytokine-receptor complex is implicated in the physiological inflammation for pathogen clearance but also the pathophysiology of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Produced mainly by activated T cells to stimulate the growth and differentiation of several multi-potential haematopoietic cells. IL3 is thought to fuel acute inflammation to create a cytokine storm. IL3 has been implicated in immune disorders including, sepsis, colitis and acts as a predictive marker for SARS-CoV-2.	IL3-IL3RA-IL3RB complex|IL3-IL3RA-IL5RB complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606
CPX-923	Nuclear cap-binding complex	Binds co-transcriptionally to the 5-prime, m7GpppG-cap (m7G-cap) structures of all RNA polymerase II transcripts (pre-mRNAs and pre-miRNAs). Required for processes such as transcription elongation, pre-mRNA splicing through commitment and NELF complexes and spliceosome formation, classic mRNA 3-prime end processing, suppression of poly-A tail formation in histone 3-prime end pre-mRNA processing in complex with serrate (Srrt/Ars2, Q99MR6) and NELF complex, nuclear export of mRNAs and U snRNAs in complex with importin-alpha and either Alyref2 (Q9JJW6) and TREX complex (mRNAs) or Phax-Xpo1/Crm1-Ran.GTP complex (U snRNAs), degradation of nuclear mRNAs via nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), primary miRNA processing in complex with serrate (Srrt/Ars2), miRNA-mediated RNA interference and the pioneer round of translation. During the pioneer round of translation it interacts with Ctif (Q6PEE2) which facilitates the eventual release of CBC from the transcript and its replacement by the cytoplasmic cap-binding complex eIF4F. In the cytosol, importin-beta interacts with CBC-bound importin-alpha and promotes the dissociation of the RNA from CBC. Importin-complex-bound CBC gets reimported into the nucleus for reuse. Ncbp1 phosphorylation correlate with increased cap-dependent splicing activity. Histone pre-mRNA processing and the pioneer round of translation may be restricted to mammalian CBC.

CPX-929	Coagulation factor VIIIa complex, heavy chain variant 1	Part of the intrinsic blood coagulation pathway (contact activation pathway). When bound to factor IXa (CPX-4945) forms the intrinsic tenase complex that cleaves Arg-|-Ile bonds of factor X (P00742) by limited proteolysis to form active factor Xa (CPX-6215) in the presence of vitamin K, Ca2+ ions, phospholipids and factor VII (P08709). The coagulation pathway is terminated when fibrinogen is cleaved to fibrin which in turn polymerizes to produce a clot. Its zymogen form is activated by limited proteolysis by thrombin (FIIa, P00734) to form active factor VIIIa. Inhibited by Active Protein C (APC, P04070).

CPX-93	MutS DNA mismatch repair complex 	Mismatch repair complex, involved in the recognition and repair of base-base and small insertion/deletion mismatches that appear as a consequence of DNA polymerase errors during replication or homologous recombination. Strand recognition necessary for removal of DNA biosynthetic errors from the daughter strand is based on the transient absence of d(GATC) methylation in the newly synthesized DNA strand (hemimethylation). Repair is initiated by the binding of mutS to a mismatch or to a small insertion-deletion loop.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:83333
CPX-930	General transcription factor complex TFIID, TAF4B variant	General transcription factor complex primarily found in spermatocytes that acts as the primary core promoter recognition factor in the initiation of RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-dependent transcription. The TBP subunit of TFIID recognizes and binds to the TATA box (if present), while TAF1 and TAF2 interact with the Initiator element (Inr), and TAF1 and the TAF6-TAF9 module recognizes the downstream core promoter element (DPE). Other core promoter elements, such as the motif ten element (MTE), may also be involved. Binding of the general transcription factor complex TFIIA (CPX-519) enhances binding of TFIID to the core promoter and nucleates pre-initiation complex (PIC) assembly. Following recruitment of TFIIA to TFIID, TFIIB, TFIIF (CPX-79), Pol II, TFIIE and TFIIH are successively assembled at the core promoter, allowing the PIC to initiate Pol II transcription. While TFIID is essential for transcription and its post-mitotic reinitiation, the loss of one or more subunits does not harm ongoing transcription during any given cell cycle. TFIID promoter binding appears to be regulated by histone modifications: TAF1 bromodomains (1361-1617 aa, IPR001487) bind the modified histone tails of acetylated H4K16, H4K5/K12 and H4K8/K16. TAF1 also appears to exhibit histone acetyltransferase activity towards histones H3 and H4. TAF3 and the PHD domains of other TFIID subunits bind modified histone tails carrying trimethylated H3K4 in combination with acetylated H3K9 and H3K14. TAF1 phosphorylates TP53 (P046370) on Thr-55, leading to TP53 degradation and G1 cell cycle progression.	Transcription factor complex IID, variant TAF4B		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606

Both IL17B and IL25 promote IL33-driven (O95760) type 2 immune responses, but perform contradictory roles in colitis; IL-25 is pathogenic and IL17B is protective. IL17B is thought to inhibit IL25 binding to IL17RA:IL17RB expressed on epithelial cells thereby limiting IL25 induced IL6 production by colonic epithelial cells.

IL17C production is up-regulated in pethelial cells at an early stage in several diseases. Unrestrained IL17C signalling is associated with autoimmune diseases and cancer progression, but it is also crucial for protection from fungal and bacterial infections such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. IL17C is induced under hypoxic and hyperglycemic conditions and is thought to drive a pathogenic inflammatory response in kidney disease.

IL17 is expressed by CD4+ type 17 helper cells, the Tc17 subset of CD8+ cells, as well as innate-acting gamma-delta T cells, natural killer T cells and TCR-beta+ natural Th17 cells. Unrestrained IL17 signalling is associated with autoimmune diseases and cancer progression, but it is also crucial for protection from fungal and bacterial infections, including the commensal Candida albicans and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Both IL25 and IL17B promote IL33-driven (O95760) type 2 immune responses, but perform contradictory roles in colitis; IL25 is pathogenic and IL17B is protective. IL17B is thought to inhibit IL25 binding to IL17RA:IL17RB expressed on epithelial cells thereby limiting IL25 induced IL6 production by colonic epithelial cells.

CPX-9308	Mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III	Key role in aerobic respiration, in which mitochondrial enzymes accept electrons from electron carriers reduced in glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase pumps protons into the intermembrane space, creating an electrochemical gradient. This is achieved by oxidizing ubiquinol (ubihydroquinone) which reacts from the membrane phase, reducing cytochrome c in the intermembrane space, and using the free energy change to transport H+ ions across the membrane from the matrix to the inter membrane space. Quinol oxidation occurs in a bifurcated reaction, in which one electron is transferred to a high potential chain and the other to a low potential chain. The high potential chain, consisting of the iron sulfur protein, cyt c1 and cyt c2, transfers the first electron from quinol to an acceptor (cytochrome oxidase). The low potential chain consists of two cyt b hemes, which serve as a pathway through which electrons are transferred across the coupling membrane.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:284812

Binding to TNFRSF6B (this complex) competitively inhibits TNFSF14's interaction with LTBR (CPX-9310) and TNFRSF14 (CPX-9223). TNFRSF6B circulating in plasma and found anchored in tissues regulates TNFSF14 bioavailability in tissue microenvironments, and TNFRSF6B binds and sequesters TNFSF14 with an affinity equal to that of TNFRSF14 and LTBR. Inflammatory signals during sepsis by elipthelial and innate immune T-cells induces TNFRSF6B secretion and decoy receptor complex formation.

TNFSF14 also mediates its effects through TNFRSF14 (CPX-9223), and the decoy receptor TNFRSF6B (CPX-9309). Expressed on myeloid cells, various tumour cell types and stromal cells in the tumour microenvrionment, TNFSF14 mediated activity has been linked with the negative selection of potentially autoreactive T cells to act as a safeguard against automimmune disease.

CPX-932	General transcription factor complex TFIID	General transcription factor complex that acts as the primary core promoter recognition factor in the initiation of RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-dependent transcription. The TBP subunit of TFIID recognizes and binds to the TATA box (if present), while Taf1 and Taf2 interact with the Initiator element (Inr), and Taf1 and the Taf6-Taf9 module recognizes the downstream core promoter element (DPE). Other core promoter elements, such as the motif ten element (MTE), may also be involved. Binding of the general transcription factor complex TFIIA (CPX-743) enhances binding of TFIID to the core promoter and nucleates pre-initiation complex (PIC) assembly. Following recruitment of TFIIA to TFIID, TFIIB, TFIIF (CPX-83), Pol II, TFIIE and TFIIH are successively assembled at the core promoter, allowing the PIC to initiate Pol II transcription. While TFIID is essential for transcription and its post-mitotic reinitiation, the loss of one or more subunits does not harm ongoing transcription during any given cell cycle. TFIID promoter binding appears to be regulated by histone modifications: Taf1 bromodomains (1382-1638 aa, IPR001487) bind the modified histone tails of acetylated H4K16, H4K5/K12 and H4K8/K16. Taf1 also appears to exhibit histone acetyltransferase activity towards histones H3 and H4. Taf3 and the PHD domains of other TFIID subunits bind modified histone tails carrying trimethylated H3K4 in combination with acetylated H3K9 and H3K14. Taf1 phosphorylates TP53 (P02340), leading to TP53 degradation and G1 cell cycle progression. Spermatocytes contain variants of TAF-containing complexes and may therefore lack fully functional TFIID.

CPX-9322	B-T lymphocyte attenuator, BTLA-TNFRSF14 complex	Receptor complex that acts as a potent inhibitor of T-cell and cytokine activation, it triggers an inhibitory signalling pathway to negatively regulate lymphocyte proliferation. TNFRSF14 binding to BTLA results in a molecular switch to a co-inhibitory form from a co-stimulatory role when bound to TNFSF14 (CPX-9309). BTLA-TNFRSF14 mediates immune tolerance by inhibiting B-cell receptor (BCR) signalling molecules. BTLA's trans-engagement with HVEM on effector T cells results in the recruitment of PTPN6/SHP-1 (P29350) and PTPN11/SHP-2 (Q06124), two potent tyrosine phosphatases, to disable early T cell activation.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606
CPX-9341	BRISC-SHMT2 complex	Endogenous deubiquitinase (DUB) inhibitor that specifically recognizes Lys63-linked ubiquitinated chains during cellular stress responses and immune signalling functions. Required for viral protein degradation, as well as IFNAR1 (P17181)/ IFNAR2 (P48551) deubiquitylation and receptor stabilization on the cell membrane. Deubiquitination of Lys63 chains on IFNAR1/IFNAR2 limits their endocytosis and lysosomal degradation, thereby increasing their cell surface expression and stability to promote type 1 interferon activity. SHMT2 performs counterintuitive functions, acting as both an inhibitor of BRISC activity as well as a key mediator of BRISC association at sites of DUB action, in its role as a reversible endogenous BRISC inhibitor that prevents non-specific DUB activity. Pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (Viatmin B6-PLP, CHEBI:18405) is key for the transition of SHMT2 from dimeric to a tetrameric state. Only the inactive, dimeric SHMT2 can interact with BRISC. An increase in intracellular PLP is associated with a reduction in BRISC-SHMT2 interaction and inflammatory signalling.

There are on average eight EJC binding sites per human mRNA, making them a major component of mature ribonucleoprotein complexes (mRNPs). EJCs selectively bind mRNPs through close association with the transcription-export complex (TREX) complex (CPX-2488, CPX-7261). TREX selectively recognizes mRNPs through its subunits ALYREF (this complex) and DDX39B. ALYREF is initially recruited by the Nuclear cap binding complex (CPX-1427) but its binding to the mRNA relies on the splicing and deposition of EJCs.

CPX-952	Caspase-1 complex	A pro-inflammatory thiol protease complex that is activated in response to pathogen infections and toxins. Primarily acts in monocytes and macrophages. Activation by autocatalytic cleavage is an ATP-dependent reaction and occurs within an activation platform, the Inflammasome (CPX-4141, CPX-4082, CPX-4144, CPX-4142 and CPX-4143). Once activated, it has a strict requirement for an Asp residue at position P1 and preferred cleavage sequence of Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-|-. It cleaves interleukins 1beta (IL1B, P01584) and IL18 (Q14116) between an Asp and an Ala, releasing the mature cytokines which are involved in a variety of inflammatory processes. Cleaves and activates sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs). Related to, but independent of, IL1B activation it is also involved in pyroptosis of macrophages, a special case of cell death, associated with infection by intracellular pathogens where it cleaves GSDMD (P57764). However, as a side effect of pyroptosis active IL1B is often released form the dead cells and therefore some link exists between both activities. While primarily a pro-inflammatory caspase it can also promote apoptosis in non-immune cells, especially in response to brain, kidney and renal cell injury.

CPX-953	MBD2/NuRD nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase complex	Corepressor complex that couples histone deacetylase and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling activities. It regulates the higher-order structure of chromatin, making chromatin more compact by removing acetyl groups from nucleosomes, and has important roles in the regulation of gene expression and DNA damage repair. The core of the complex is composed of six groups of proteins, each one with several paralogues (Hdac1/2, Mta1/2/3, Rbbp4/7, Gatad2a/b, Mbd2, and Chd3/4). Combinatorial assembly of these isoforms contributes to the targeting and function of the complex. It is currently not known whether Gatad2a/Gatad2b, Rbbp4/Rbbp7, and Mta1/Mta2/Mta3 form heterodimers/trimers or mutually exclusive homodimers/trimers. The Chd3/4 ATPase, utilizes energy derived from hydrolysis of ATP for DNA sliding and repositioning of nucleosomes. The second catalytic subunit, Hdac1/2 (histone deacetylase), deacetylates acetylated lysine residues of histone and non-histone proteins. This dual enzymatic activity is proposed to be important for the efficient formation of heterochromatin with densely packed hypoacetylated nucleosomes and the rapid termination of gene transcription. In addition to the well-described core subunits, a large number of proteins have been reported to interact with the NuRD complex, like Doc1 (O35207), Kpna2 (P52293), Zmynd8 (A2A484), Znf512b/532/592/687(Q6PHP4, Q6NXK2 , Q8BHZ4, Q9D2D7), Sall4 (Q8BX22), Prmt5 (Q8CIG8), Mep50 (Q99J09).

The complex mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins. The complex is formed at presynaptic periactive zones along dorsal and ventral nerve cords and targets proteins such as scd-2, an ALK tyrosine kinase receptor, to stabilize synapse formation. Required for the restriction and/or maturation of synapses in GABAergic neuromuscular junction (NMJ) presynaptic neurons.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:6239

PhK complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606
CPX-959	General transcription factor complex TFIID, Taf4b variant	General transcription factor complex primarily found in spermatocytes that acts as the primary core promoter recognition factor in the initiation of RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-dependent transcription. The TBP subunit of TFIID recognizes and binds to the TATA box (if present), while Taf1 and Taf2 interact with the Initiator element (Inr), and Taf1 and the Taf6-Taf9 module recognizes the downstream core promoter element (DPE). Other core promoter elements, such as the motif ten element (MTE), may also be involved. Binding of the general transcription factor complex TFIIA (CPX-743) enhances binding of TFIID to the core promoter and nucleates pre-initiation complex (PIC) assembly. Following recruitment of TFIIA to TFIID, TFIIB, TFIIF (CPX-83), Pol II, TFIIE and TFIIH are successively assembled at the core promoter, allowing the PIC to initiate Pol II transcription. While TFIID is essential for transcription and its post-mitotic reinitiation, the loss of one or more subunits does not harm ongoing transcription during any given cell cycle. TFIID promoter binding appears to be regulated by histone modifications: Taf1 bromodomains (1382-1638 aa, IPR001487) bind the modified histone tails of acetylated H4K16, H4K5/K12 and H4K8/K16. Taf1 also appears to exhibit histone acetyltransferase activity towards histones H3 and H4. Taf3 and the PHD domains of other TFIID subunits bind modified histone tails carrying trimethylated H3K4 in combination with acetylated H3K9 and H3K14. Taf1 phosphorylates TP53 (P02340), leading to TP53 degradation and G1 cell cycle progression.	Transcription factor complex IID, variant Taf4b		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:10090

CPX-9601	CXCL8-CXCR1 receptor-ligand complex	Chemotactic receptor complex involved in neutrophil activation. CXCL8 is a member of the ELR+ CXC subfamily of chemokines known to activate neutrophils and dimerise under physiological conditions. CXCL8 mediates its effects through binding to its G-protein coupled receptors, CXCR1 (this complex) and CXCR2 (CPX-9821). CXCL8 is secreted by cells at sites of injury and infection to trigger a transient increase in cytosolic calcium in neutrophils via a GTP-binding protein and chemotaxis through both CXCR1 and CXCR2, but only CXCR1 can mediate phospholipase D activation and respiratory burst.

CPX-961	Mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint, MAD1-MAD2 complex	Acts at the spindle checkpoint, in a surveillance mechanism that mediates a delay in the onset of anaphase, until all chromosomes are properly attached to the mitotic or meiotic spindle. Required for the checkpoint response to absence of spindle tension, localising only to unattached kinetochores but not to attached kinetochores that lack tension, and participate in a bipolar orientation defect signaling pathway. MAD2 adopts two distinct conformations; when unbound, it adopts an open conformation (O-Mad2) but upon binding to MAD1 (or CDC20, P26309), two beta-sheets move across the face of the protein to create the closed conformation (C-Mad2), with MAD1 now trapped within this fold. Upon mitotic entry, the Mad1-C-Mad2 core complex is recruited to kinetochores. Because Mad2 can dimerise, O-Mad2 from the cytosol can then be recruited to kinetochore-bound Mad1-C-Mad2. C-Mad2 within the Mad1-C-Mad2 core complex acts as a prion-like template, catalysing the conversion of additional O-Mad2 proteins to the closed conformation and in doing so binding Cdc20 (CPX-962).

CPX-962	Mitotic checkpoint complex, CDC20-MAD2 subcomplex	Acts at the spindle checkpoint, in a surveillance mechanism that mediates a metaphase delay, until all chromosomes are properly attached to the mitotic or meiotic spindle, by sequestering Cdc20, thus preventing the activation of the the ubiquitin ligase activity of the anaphase-promoting complex (CPX-760). This ensures all chromosomes are correctly attached in a bipolar fashion to the mitotic spindle.	Mad2-Cdc20 complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:559292

CPX-963	Mitotic checkpoint complex, MAD2-MAD3-BUB3-CDC20	Acts at the spindle checkpoint in a surveillance mechanism that mediates a delay in the onset of anaphase until all chromosomes are properly attached to the mitotic or meiotic spindle by inhibiting the anaphase-promoting complex (CPX-760), an E3 ubquitin ligase complex required for onset of anaphase. The Mitotic checkpoint complex is a more potent inhibitor of the APC/C than Mad2-Cdc20 alone (CPX-962).	MCC complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:559292
CPX-964	GTPase-Activating Protein BFA1-BUB2 complex	Acts as a two-component GTPase-activating protein for TEM1 (P38987) GTPase, thus regulating a signal transduction cascade, called the mitotic exit network (MEN), which is required for mitotic exit and cytokinesis. The BUB2/BFA1 GAP binds TEM1 GTPase at spindle poles, achieving an asymmetry during mitosis when the spindle is properly positioned, with the complex accumulating on the bud-directed old spindle pole. BUB2/BFA1 keeps TEM1 inactive until the spindle is properly oriented, thus inhibiting MEN activation. Upon spindle misalignment TEM1 localizes symmetrically on both SPBs and the Spindle Position Checkpoint (SPOC) inhibits TEM1 through the BUB2/BFA1 complex, thereby restraining the MEN until the spindle repositions correctly.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:559292
CPX-9641	Mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV	Terminal oxidase of the electron transport chain in mitochondria. It accepts electrons from cytochrome c to reduce the oxygen to water and pumps two protons from the matrix side to the intermembrane space. Electrons originating from reduced cytochrome c in the intermembrane space are transferred via the dinuclear copper center of mt:CoII and heme A of mt:CoI to the active site in mt:CoI, a binuclear center formed by heme A3 and a second copper atom. The binuclear center reduces molecular oxygen to 2 water molecules using 4 electrons from cytochrome c in the intermembrane space and 4 protons from the mitochondrial matrix.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:284812

CPX-967	Nuclear mitotic cohesin complex	Required for sister chromatid cohesion during cell division, which enables cells to attach sister kinetochores to microtubules with opposing polarity (bi-orientation) and subsequently resists the tendency of these microtubules to pull chromatids toward opposite spindle poles. Before the commencement of replication, the cohesin complex is loaded onto DNA. The arms of the him-1 and smc-3 molecules embrace the DNA, thereby forming a ring. The head domains of him-1 and smc-3 are locked together by scc-1. Cohesion might be generated as the replication fork passes through the ring, entrapping both sister chromatids inside. At the metaphase to anaphase transition, scc-1 is cleaved by separase, thereby opening the lock of the him-1 and smc-3 head domains. The ring opens and sister chromatids can be pulled to opposite spindle poles.	Cohesin complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:6239
CPX-968	Oligosaccharyltransferase complex	Transfers the dolicholphosphate-linked core oligosaccharide to selected Asn-X-Ser/Thr sequences of the nascent polypeptide chain, a key step in N-glycosylation of secretory and membrane-bound proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum.

CPX-969	Caspase-2 complex	Thiol-dependent aspartate-specific protease complex possessing features of both initiator and executioner caspases and required in stress-induced apoptosis. Genotoxic stress, mitotic catastrophe, heat shock, ER stress or bacterial toxins can stimulate Caspase-2 activation. It is activated by autocatalytic cleavage in the Caspase-2-PIDDosome (CPX-3905). Once activated, it is released from the PIDDosome and induces BID (P55957) cleavage, BAX (Q07812) translocation to mitochondria, subsequent Cytochrome c (P99999) release and consequent activation of the apoptotic process. Specifically cleaves substrates with an aspartic acid residue at position P1 and has a preferred cleavage sequence of Val-Asp-Val-Ala-Asp-|-. In addition, Caspase-2 has been reported to be a negative regulator of necroptosis and to be indispensable for correct cell proliferation and genomic stability acting as a potential tumor suppressor factor. Caspase-2 is negatively regulated by phosphorylation at distinct sites (Ser157 and Ser340) during cell division and in nutrient abundance conditions. In response to heat shock, Caspase-2 activity is suppressed by the chaperone HSP90AA1(P07900). Decreased level of Caspase-2 associated with childhood forms of drug-resistance acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and decreased Caspase-2 expression was observed in mantle cell lymphoma tumor samples. Caspase-2 is associated with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Huntington'd diseases.	Active CASP2|Active Caspase-2|Casp2 tetramer|Caspase-2 tetramer		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606
CPX-97	Myc-Max transcriptional activator complex	Proto-oncogenic transcriptional activator recognizing E box hexanucleotide.

At the onset of apoptosis it proteolytically cleaves poly[ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP1, P09874) at a '216-Asp-|-Gly-217' bond. It is also the primary activator of apoptotic DNA fragmentation through inactivation of DNA fragmentation factor subunit alpha (DFFA - O00273).

CPX-971	Caspase-6 complex	A cysteine protease complex that specifically cleaves substrates with an aspartic acid residue at position P1 and has a preferred cleavage sequence of Val-Glu-His-Asp-|-. Caspase-6 is an initiator enzyme involved in the activation cascade of caspases responsible for apoptosis execution. Caspase-6 is capable of autoactivation and/or may be activated via proteolytic cleavage by Caspase-3 (CPX-970), Caspase-8 (CPX-975) or Caspase-10 (Q92851). Once activated it cleaves pro-Caspase-2 (P42575), pro-Caspase-8 (Q14790) and pro-Caspase-10 allowing their oligomerization into active Caspase-2 (CPX-969), Caspase-8 and Caspase-10. Caspase-6 induces mitochondrial permeabilisation, which leads to cytochrome c release and activation of the Apotosome (CPX-3762). Caspase-6 plays a role in neurodegenerative disease such as Huntigton disease (HD) and Alzheimer's disease. In HD, a mutant huntingtin (mHTT) protein features expanded polyglutamine repeats at its N-terminus. Caspase-6 is a key processing enzyme responsible for the cleavage of mHTT.

CPX-9721	Interleukin 11-sIL11RA-IL-6ST receptor-ligand trans-signalling complex	Trans-signalling cytokine-receptor complex that acts as an agonist to induce signalling in cells that do not express membrane-bound IL11RA (mIL11RA). IL11 binds to a soluble form of its specific receptor component, sIL11RA and recruits the ubiquitously expressed IL6ST to activate signalling via IL6ST's tyrosine residue Tyr-759 initiating the apoptotic MAPK (ERK) pathway, or to a lesser extent, the pro-survival STAT3 pathway. sIL11RA is formed either by proteolysis of mIL11RA by ADAM10 (O14672) at Arginine 355, or directly secreted from cells after alternative mRNA splicing. IL11 is produced by fibroblasts and epithelial cells in addition to various immune cell types. It is classically-associated with a regenerative role in megakaryocytopoiesis but has also been critically implicated in the tumourigenesis of gastrointestinal and epithelial cancers. The exact role of IL11 mediated trans-signalling is yet to be elucidated but it is thought that IL11 trans-signalling may drive disease conditions.	IL11 Trans-signalling complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606
CPX-973	Complement C3b complex	A protein complex of the alternative pathway of complement activation of the innate immune system. Complement C3 precursor is activated by cleavage into C3a and C3b by C3 convertases, either C4bC2a in the classical and lectin pathways or C3(H2O)Bb, C3bBb, C3bBbC3b, C3bBbP or C3bBbC3bP in the alternative pathway. C3b acts as an opsonin and interacts with glycoproteins and carbohydrates on pathogenic or apoptotic target cell surfaces through its reactive thioester moiety. Opsonization of target cells leads to enhanced phagocytosis, lysis of target cells via membrane attack complex (CPX-6159) assembly, clearance of antibody-antigen complexes and up-regulation of the adaptive response. Activation of C3b leads to an amplification cascade that generates more C3 convertase, deposits more C3b at the local site and switches C3 convertases to C5 convertases. To protect host cells from inadvertent complement activation the activation of C3b is tightly regulated by either disrupting the C3 convertases or aiding in the proteolytic degradation of C3b. Bacteria and viruses possess C3b proteases to evade the complement response. Lack of protection, due to familial mutations in the complement genes or the presence of autoantibodies against regulators has been linked to atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and C3 glomerulopathies (C3G) in kidneys and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in eyes. Conditions of chronic and acute inflammations, as in rheumatoid arthritis, strokes, and heart attacks, become aggravated by complement activation against the disturbed tissue.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606
CPX-974	SRCAP chromatin remodeling complex	ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex that catalyzes the exchange of H2A/H2B for H2A.Z/H2B in nucleosomes, thus regulating transcription of a specific subset of genes. Whether VPS72 and ZNHIT1 are part of the core complex is unclear. The first study (PMID:16634648) to show the histone exchange activity were not able to identify these two proteins in the purified active complex, whereas a previous study (PMID:15647280) purified a complex that contained the two proteins, but showed no functional activity in the exchange assay. A recent study (PMID: 25176633) claimed that the SRCAP complex may also be involved in double strand DNA repair by homologous recombination. However, this was only demonstrated for the SRCAP protein, and not the complex.

It is activated via proteolytic cleavage by the DISC complex. Once activated, Caspase-8 cleaves and activates Caspase-3, Caspase-4 (P49662), Caspase-6 (CPX-971), Caspase-7 (CPX-2862), Caspase-9 (CPX-991 and CPX-3762) and Caspase-10 (Q92851).

Forms at the cell cortex during mating, when a Far1-Cdc24 complex translocates from the nucleus. Recruits Cdc42 (P19073) and Bem1 (P29366) away from the bud site, thus providing the switch from bud growth to polarized growth, enabling the cell to project a shmoo towards the source of a pheromone gradient, and thus grow towards the mating partner. Binding to Gbetagamma may trigger a conformational change in Far1 that is required for its ability to activate Cdc24.	CDC24-FAR1-BG complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:559292
CPX-978	NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex	Histone acetyl transferase (HAT) complex involved in transcriptional activation of selected genes, mostly involved in apoptosis, cell-cycle regulation and hypoxia. Examples of regulated genes include TP53 (P04637)-dependent transcription genes, those containing promoters regulated by MYC (P01106) and highly transcribed genes such as those encoding ribosomal proteins. The major acetylation targets are lysines-5, 8, and 12 on nucleosomal H4, K5 and K15 on H2A, histone variants H2AZ and H2AX, as well as non-histone substrates such as TP53. The NuA4 complex can also acetylate H3 in free histones. A core complex formed by the subunits KAT5, EPC1, and ING3 is sufficient to enable strong HAT activity on nucleosomal templates (Piccolo NuA4 CPX-709). The NuA4 complex is rapidly recruited at double-strand breaks (DSBs) during double strand break repair to acetylate H4, H2A, and H2AX, thereby facilitating chromatin opening.

CPX-9781	Interleukin 11-mIL11RA-IL-6ST receptor-ligand complex	Cytokine-receptor complex. IL11 binds to a membrane-bound form of its specific receptor component, mIL11RA and recruits the ubiquitously expressed IL6ST to activate signalling via IL6ST's Tyr-759 initiating either the apoptotic MAPK (ERK) pathway, or to a lesser extent, the pro-survival STAT3 pathway. IL11 is produced by fibroblasts and epithelial cells in addition to various immune cell types. It is classically-associated with a regenerative role in megakaryocytopoiesis but has also been critically implicated in the tumourigenesis of gastrointestinal and epithelial cancers. IL11 is thought to be a contributor in driving the pathogenesis of autoimmune inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthiritis and multiple sclerosis as well as chronic inflammatory conditions such as asthma.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606

CPX-9821	CXCL8-CXCR2 receptor-ligand complex	Chemotactic receptor complex involved in neutrophil activation. CXCL8 is a member of the ELR+ CXC subfamily of chemokines known to activate neutrophils and dimerise under physiological conditions. CXCL8 mediates its effects through binding to its G-protein coupled receptors, CXCR1 (CPX-9601) and CXCR2 (this complex). CXCL8 is secreted by cells at sites of injury and infection to trigger a transient increase in cytosolic calcium in neutrophils via a GTP-binding protein and chemotaxis through both CXCR1 and CXCR2, but only CXCR1 can mediate phospholipase D activation and respiratory burst.

CPX-983	ICAP1-KRIT1 integrin activation complex	Complex formation prevents the beta1-integrin binding protein ICAP1 from binding to, and limiting the activation of, beta1-integrin. ICAP1 is a known suppressor of integrin activation believed to act by competing with the integrin activators talin (Q9Y490) and kindlin (Q9BQL6) by competitively binding to the integrin beta1 cytoplasmic tail. Complex formation may also sequester ICAP1 to the nucleus.	ICAP1-CCM1 complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606
CPX-984	CCM endothelial permeability complex	Forms a signalling platform, responsible for maintaining integrity of endothelial permeability. Plays a key role in the integrity of the endothelial tubule networks at the initial stages of vasculogenesis.

CPX-9841	CXCL8-ACKR1, atypical receptor-ligand complex	Atypical chemokine-receptor complex that controls the bioavailability of CXCL8 and its localization. Produced mainly by non-leukocytes, ACKR1 primarily acts as a scavenging receptor to dampen CXCL8 mediated immune responses by binding, internalizing, and degrading it. However, ACKR1 can promote CXCL8 transcytosis promoting inflammation. ACKR1 is used by Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium knowlesi as an entry receptor for erythrocyte invasion and a silencing mutation in ACKR1's promoter region is associated with a resistance to malaria found in the majority of Sub-saharan Afrian populations	CXCL8-DARC complex|CXCL8-scavenging receptor complex|Duffy antigen-chemokine receptor complex|IL8-FY complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606

CPX-9861	Augmin complex	Regulates mitotic spindle assembly and centrosome integrity and is required for completion of cytokinesis. The complex interacts with the gamma-tubulin ring complex (CPX-2801) and this interaction is required for spindle assembly.	HAUS complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:7227
CPX-988	Complement C3b complex	A protein complex of the alternative pathway of complement activation of the innate immune system. Complement C3 precurser is activated by cleavage into C3a and C3b by C3 convertases, either C4bC2a in the classical and lectin pathways or C3(H2O)Bb, C3bBb, C3bBbC3b, C3bBbP or C3bBbC3bP in the alternative pathway. C3b acts as an opsonin and interacts with glycoproteins and carbohydrates on pathogenic or apoptotic target cell surfaces through its reactive thioester moiety. Opsonization of target cells leads to enhanced phagocytosis, lysis of target cells via membrane attack complex (CPX-6159) assembly, clearance of antibody-antigen complexes and upregulation of the adaptive response. Activation of C3b leads to an amplification cascade that generates more C3 convertase, deposits more C3b at the local site and switches C3 convertases to C5 convertases. To protect host cells from inadvertent complement activation the activation of C3b is tightly regulated by either disrupting the C3 convertases or aiding in the proteolytic degradation of C3b. Bacteria and viruses possess C3b proteases to evade the complement response.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:10090
CPX-9881	MutSgamma meiotic recombination complex	Binds to double Holliday Junctions and other DNA repair intermediates.

CPX-989	PCAF histone acetylase complex	A histone acetyl transferase complex that plays a role in regulation of transcription of a specific group of genes by increasing the decompaction of chromatin to facilitate the access of transcription factors to promoter regions. It preferentially acetylates a single residue of Histone H3 (Lys-14) and is only able to weakly acetylate a single residue of Histone H4 (Lys-8) within nucleosomal substrates. The complex may also acetylate non-histone proteins, such as transcription factors. .	p300/CBP associated factor complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606
CPX-99	Beta-catenin destruction core complex, APC2-AXIN1-GSK3B variant	Phosphorylates cytoplasmic beta-catenin (CTNNB1, P35222) in the absence of WNT-signalling, thus positively controlling its continuous proteasome-mediated degradation. CSNK1A1 phosphorylates CTNNB1 on Ser-45 and primes successive phosphorylation of Thr-41, Ser-37, and Ser-33 by GSK3. Phosphorylation of CTNNB1 promotes its subsequent ubiquitination which targets the protein for degradation by the proteasome. Without WNT, Axin is also phosphorylated by GSK3, and thereby kept in an active, open conformation for beta-catenin binding and degradation. Upon WNT stimulation, the ternary WNT-FZ-LRP6 complex is formed, recruits the scaffold protein DVL and the beta-catenin destruction complex. As a result, GSK3 is inhibited, CTNNB1 is not ubiquitinated and accumulates in the nucleus, where it acts as a coactivator for transcription factors of the TCF/LEF family, leading to activation of WNT responsive genes.

CPX-990	NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex	Histone acetyl transferase (HAT) complex involved in transcriptional activation of selected genes, mostly involved in apoptosis, cell-cycle regulation and hypoxia. Examples of regulated genes include Tp53 (P02340)-dependent transcription genes, those containing promoters regulated by Myc (P01108) and highly transcribed genes such as those encoding ribosomal proteins. The major acetylation targets are lysines-5, 8, and 12 on nucleosomal H4, K5 and K15 on H2A, histone variants H2AZ and H2AX, as well as non-histone substrates such as Tp53. The NuA4 complex can also acetylate H3 in free histones. A core complex formed by the subunits Kat5, Epc1, and Ing3 is sufficient to enable strong HAT activity on nucleosomal templates (Piccolo NuA4 CPX-747). The NuA4 complex is rapidly recruited at double-strand breaks (DSBs) during double strand break repair to acetylate H4, H2A, and H2AX, thereby facilitating chromatin opening.

CPX-9901	MutLalpha endonuclease complex	Endonuclease complex which nicks a DNA strand containing a pre-existing nick, presumably to provide an entry site for a mispair excision reaction. Required for DNA mismatch repair (MMR), correcting base-base mismatches and insertion-deletion loops resulting from DNA replication, DNA damage or from recombination events between non-identical sequences during meiosis. ATP binding induces a conformational change in the MutSalpha/MSH2-MSH6 (CPX-80) and MutSbeta/MSH2-MSH3 (CPX-77) complexes which converts these to a clamp form that slides along the DNA and leads to recruitment of MutLalpha/MLH1-PMS2, MutLbeta/MLH1-PMS1 (CPX-9941) and MLH1-MLH3 (CPX-9961).

Generates the active forms of Caspase-3 (CPX-970) and Caspase-7 (CPX-2862) by limited proteolysis, and thereby transmit the apoptotic signal to the execution phase. Caspase-9 is mostly active as part of a multicomponent complex known as the apoptosome (CPX-3762), however it has residual catalytic activity on its own.

ATP binding induces a conformational change in the MutSalpha/MSH2-MSH6 (CPX-80) and MutSbeta/MSH2-MSH3 (CPX-77) complexes which converts these to a clamp form that slides along the DNA and leads to recruitment of MutLalpha/MLH1-PMS2 (CPX-9901), MutLbeta/MLH1-PMS1 and MutLgamma/MLH1-MLH3 (CPX-9961). MutLbeta appears to function in repair of single base pair mismatches and small insertion/deletion mispairs.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:9606
CPX-995	KEOPS tRNA N6-adenosine threonylcarbamoyltransferase complex	Catalyses the transfer of the threonylcarbamoyl-moiety of threonylcarbamoyladenylate (TCA) onto A37 of substrate tRNA in the cytoplasm. The N6-threonylcarbamoyladenosine (t6A) modification is present at position 37 of tRNAs that recognize ANN-codons, with N being any nucleotide, enhancing the codon-anti-codon interaction and is required for recognition of the AUG start codon. The modification is thus important for maintaining translational fidelity and also appears to play a role in transcription and telomere homeostasis. The unstable TCA intermediate is synthesised from ATP, threonine and bicarbonate by the SUA5 (P32579) enzyme.

CPX-996	Cas1-Cas2 complex	CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat), is an adaptive immune system that provides protection against mobile genetic elements (viruses, transposable elements and conjugative plasmids). The system memorizes previous infections by integrating short sequences of invading genomes (spacers) into the CRISPR locus. The spacers, interspaced with repeats, are expressed as small guide CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) that are employed by Cas proteins to target invaders sequence-specifically upon a reoccurring infection. The Cas1-Cas 2 complex is essential for the incorporation of 33-bp long sequence-variable foreign DNA protospacers into the host CRISPR locus. CRISPR transcripts generated from the loci assemble with Cas proteins to detect and cleave foreign nucleic acids bearing sequence complementarity to the spacer segment. Cas1 is the probable nuclease that catalyzes the integration reaction, whilst Cas2 may provide a structural scaffold and stimulate the catalytic activity of Cas1	Cas1 - Cas2 integrase complex		go:0032991	ncbitaxon:83333

CPX-997	GCN5-containing ATAC complex	A histone acetyl transferase complex that plays a role in regulation of transcription of a specific group of genes by increasing the decompaction of chromatin to facilitate the access of transcription factors to promoter regions. It preferentially acetylates a single residue of Histone H3 (Lys-14) and only weakly acetylates Histone H4. Recruited to the promoters of the IE (immediate early) gene FOS (P01100), FOSL1 (P15407), EGR1 (P18146). The complex also regulates the activity of non-histone targets and orchestrates mitotic progression by regulating Cyclin A degradation through acetylation.Cyclin A/CDK2 kinase is essential for correct centrosome formation and inhibits SIRT2 (Q8IXJ6) function.

CPX-998	Calcineurin-Calmodulin-AKAP5 complex, beta-R1 variant	Calcium-dependent, calmodulin-stimulated protein phosphatase calcineurin in complex with plasma-membrane anchor protein AKAP5. Calcineurin is important for cardiac development and pathophysiology, for nervous-system development and for some of the plastic changes in neurons that are believed to underlie learning and memory. AKAP5 recruits calcineurin to the vicinity of L-type Ca2+ channels for their activation by elevated Ca2+ entering the cell. AKAP5 balances the opposing effects of calcineurin and protein kinase A (PKA) (P17612) on neuronal voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels and coordinates the activities of calcineurin, PKA and PKC on a number of other channels and receptors. Despite its atypical PxIxIT calcineurin-recognition motif that confers stronger binding affinity by calcineurin than other substrates it allows for effective disengagement of calcineurin to couple channel activation with downstream signaling events. The calcineurin-AKAP5 complex has been shown to promote NFAT signaling.

CPX-999	MET4-MET28-MET31 sulfur metabolism transcription factor complex	Transcription factor complex regulating sulfur metabolism. MET4 lacks DNA-binding ability and relies on interactions with MET31 and MET32 (Q03081), paralogous proteins that bind the same cis-regulatory element, to activate its targets. MET31 and MET32 are C2H2 zinc finger-containing proteins that act solely as adaptors for recruiting MET4 to promoters, binding to sites with a TGTGGC core. MET28 acts to stabilise the complex.			go:0032991	ncbitaxon:559292
