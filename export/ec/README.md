# Enzyme Nomenclature

The Enzyme Nomenclature (also known as the Enzyme Commission Code) is a species-agnostic controlled vocabulary for specific enzymes and an associated hierarchical classification into 7 main categories.

The Enzyme Nomenclature is maintained by the [Nomenclature Committee](https://iubmb.org/about/committees/nomenclature-committee/) of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB). A detailed history of the nomenclature since the 1950s can be found [here](https://iubmb.qmul.ac.uk/enzyme/history.html).

There are few notable resources providing access to the Enzyme Nomenclature:
