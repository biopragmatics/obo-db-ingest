Well established for their oncogenic properties\, the cyclins and the cyclin-dependent kinases \(CDK's\) they activate have been the focus of major research and development efforts over the past decade. The methods by which the cyclins are misregulated are widely variable\, ranging from genomic amplification to changes in promoter methylation. Cyclin D3 loss has been reported in T-ALL\, a seemingly unique trend when compared to the amplifcations and overexpressions of the other cyclin D's. In a mouse study\, the targeted therapeutic palbociclib significantly increased the median survival of the cyclin D3 knockouts."

The interaction of PD1/PDL1 is hypothesized to be a possible mechanism for the tumor to escape immune response.

def: "CDKN2A loss has been shown to be a significant event in a number of cancer types. While no targeted therapeutic has been engaged in clinical trials\, the prognostic impact has been studied by a number of meta-analyses. In majority of cases CDKN2A is inactivated by homozygous deletions. One of the mechanisms by which loss of CDKN2A can occur is by hypermethylation of the promoter region for the gene. However\, the prognostic impact of promoter hypermethylation has been relatively ambiguous. Many studies have suggesting poorer prognostic outcome for patients with hypermethylation in colorectal\, liver\, and younger lung cancer patients. This being said\, there is still research to be done before this becomes a widely-accepted prognostic indicator. Additionally\, CDKN2A \(p16\) expression is a surrogate marker for HPV infection. As such\, CDKN2A expression is prognostic in Oropharyngeal and probably also non-oropharyngeal head and neck squamous cell carcinomas."

def: "FGFR1 is a member of the Fibroblast Growth Factor family\, comprising of 4 receptors and 18 Ligands. FGFR1 signalling downstream functions mainly via PI3K and MAPK pathways \(Turner et. al.\). Several ways of involvement of FGFR1 in cancer have been proposed\: auto- and paracrine activation\, amplification and overexpression \(Marshall et. al\, Weiss et. al.\, Cheng et. al.\). Especially amplification of FGFR1 in lung cancer is an emerging treatment target with clinical studies currently ongoing \(e.g. NCT01004224\). However\, FGFR1 amplification does not always correlate with protein expression and predictive biomarkers still remain to be defined in clinic \(von Mässenhausen et. al.\). Mutation of FGFR1 seems to be less common\, but has been described in glioblastoma\, pilocytic astrocytomas and Ewing's sarcoma \(Rand et. al.\, Jones et. al.\, Agelopoulos et. al.\)."

def: "EGFR is widely recognized for its importance in cancer. Amplification and mutations have been shown to be driving events in many cancer types. Its role in non-small cell lung cancer\, glioblastoma and basal-like breast cancers has spurred many research and drug development efforts. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown efficacy in EGFR amplfied tumors\, most notably gefitinib and erlotinib. Mutations in EGFR have been shown to confer resistance to these drugs\, particularly the variant T790M\, which has been functionally characterized as a resistance marker for both of these drugs. The later generation TKI's have seen some success in treating these resistant cases\, and targeted sequencing of the EGFR locus has become a common practice in treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Overproduction of ligands is another possible mechanism of activation of EGFR. ERBB ligands include EGF\, TGF-a\, AREG\, EPG\, BTC\, HB-EGF\, EPR and NRG1-4 \(for detailed information please refer to the respective ligand section\)."

Mis-regulation of isoform expression has been shown to be a driving event in cancer\, as well as missense mutations at the three hotspots previously mentioned. While highly recurrent in cancer\, targeting these RAS mutants has also been very elusive\, and has not yet become common practice in the clinic."

There is no single hotspot in the DNA binding domain\, but a majority of mutations occur in amino acid positions 175\, 245\, 248\, 273\, and 282 \(NM_000546\) \(Olivier et al.\, 2010\). To fulfill its proper biological function four TP53 polypeptides must form a tetramer which functions as a transcription factor\, therefore even if one out of four polypeptides has inactivating mutation it may lead to dominant negative phenotype of variable degree. While a large proportion of cancer genomics research is focused on somatic variants\, TP53 is also of note in the germline. Germline TP53 mutations are the hallmark of Li-Fraumeni syndrome\, and many \(both germline and somatic\) variants have been found to have a prognostic impact on patient outcomes. The significance of many polymorphisms for susceptibility and prognosis of disease is still very much up for debate."

def: "BRAF mutations are found to be recurrent in many cancer types. Of these\, the mutation of valine 600 to glutamic acid \(V600E\) is the most prevalent. V600E has been determined to be an activating mutation\, and cells that harbor it\, along with other V600 mutations are sensitive to the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib. It is also common to use MEK inhibition as a substitute for BRAF inhibitors\, and the MEK inhibitor trametinib has seen some success in BRAF mutant melanomas. BRAF mutations have also been correlated with poor prognosis in many cancer types\, although there is at least one study that questions this conclusion in papillary thyroid cancer. Oncogenic BRAF mutations are divided into three categories that determine their sensitivity to inhibitors. Class 1 BRAF mutations \(V600\) are RAS-independent\, signal as monomers and are sensitive to current RAF monomer inhibitors. Class 2 BRAF mutations \(K601E\, K601N\, K601T\, L597Q\, L597V\, G469A\, G469V\, G469R\, G464V\, G464E\, and fusions\) are RAS-independent\, signaling as constitutive dimers and are resistant to vemurafenib. Such mutants may be sensitive to novel RAF dimer inhibitors or MEK inhibitors. Class 3 BRAF mutations \(D287H\, V459L\, G466V\, G466E\, G466A\, S467L\, G469E\, N581S\, N581I\, D594N\, D594G\, D594A\, D594H\, F595L\, G596D\, and G596R\) with low or absent kinase activity are RAS-dependent and they activate ERK by increasing their binding to activated RAS and wild-type CRAF. Class 3 BRAF mutations coexist with mutations in RAS or NF1 in melanoma may be treated with MEK inhibitors. In epithelial tumors such as CRC or NSCLC may be effectively treated with combinations that include inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinase."

name: VHL
def: "Von Hippel-Lindau \(VHL\) disease is characterized by heterozygous germline mutation in VHL gene on chromosome 3p. Patients are predisposed to developing hemangioblastomas of the brain\, spinal cord\, and retina; renal cysts and clear cell renal cell carcinoma; pheochromocytoma\, pancreatic cysts and neuroendocrine tumors; endolymphatic sac tumors; and epididymal and broad ligament cysts. Cerebellar hemangioblastomas may be associated with headache\, vomiting\, gait disturbances\, or ataxia. Spinal hemangioblastomas and related syrinx usually present with pain. Sensory and motor loss may develop with cord compression. Retinal hemangioblastomas may be the initial manifestation of VHL disease and can cause vision loss. Renal cell carcinoma occurs in about 70% of individuals with VHL and is the leading cause of mortality. Pheochromocytomas can be asymptomatic but may cause sustained or episodic hypertension. Pancreatic lesions often remain asymptomatic and rarely cause endocrine or exocrine insufficiency. Endolymphatic sac tumors can cause hearing loss of varying severity\, which can be a presenting symptom. Cystadenomas of the epididymis are relatively common. They rarely cause problems\, unless bilateral\, in which case they may result in infertility. The VHL gene product encodes pVHL\, which binds to elongin C\, elongin B\, cullin-2 and Rbx1. This complex catalyzes the polyubiquitinylation of specific proteins and targets them for degradation by proteosomes. For example\, under normoxic conditions\, hydroxylated hypoxia-inducble factor alpha subunits \(HIFα\) binds pVHL targets HIFα for degradation. Under hypoxic conditions\, HIF1α is not hydroxylated\, pVHL does not bind\, and HIF1α subunits accumulate. HIF1α forms heterodimers with HIF1β and activates transcription of a variety of hypoxia-inducible genes \(i.e.\, VEGF\, EPO\, TGFα\, PDGFβ\). Likewise\, when pVHL is absent or mutated\, HIF1α subunits accumulate\, resulting in cell proliferation and the neovascularization of tumors characteristic of VHL disease. Pathogenic variants in VHL either prevent its expression \(i.e.\, deletions\, frameshifts\, nonsense mutations\, and splice site mutations\) or lead to the expression of an abnormal protein \(i.e.\, missense mutations\). Missense mutations that destabilize packing of the alpha-helical domains\, decrease the stability of the alpha-beta domain interface\, interfere with binding of elongin C and HIF1α\, or disrupt hydrophobic core residues result in loss of HIF regulation and are more likely to result in VHL type 1 \(no predisposition to pheochromocytoma\). Missense mutations that result in pVHL that is normal with respect to HIF regulation are more likely to be associated with VHL with clinical pheochromocytoma. Acquired somatic pathogenic variants in VHL may give rise to sporadic VHL-type tumors \(i.e.\, clear cell RCC and hemangioblastoma\) without other associated tumors characteristic of the hereditary disease. It should be noted that >90% of the most common form of kidney cancer \(clear cell renal cell carcinoma\) are associated with bi-allelic somatic mutation in the VHL gene\, and is the rationale for the anti-angiogenic therapy for RCC patients."

These findings have been the impetus for the increased popularity of genetic testing of healthy individuals to assess risk. Recent studies in ovarian cancer have also demonstrated that BRCA mutation status can predict treatment response. A number of trials assessing BRCA mutation status have shown an improved response to platinum agents\, and more recently has led to the FDA-approval of PARP inhibitors for BRCA-positive ovarian cancers. These studies have resulted in the Society of Gynecologic Oncology to recommend germline BRCA testing in all patients with a diagnosis of ovarian cancer."

def: "Ataxia-telangiectasia \(A-T\) is a recessive disorder resulting from germline mutation of the A-T mutated \(ATM\) gene on chromosome 11q. Upon sensing double-stranded breaks \(DSB\)\, the wild-type kinase encoded by ATM initiates the DNA-damage response by phosphorylating histone H2AX and\, subsequently\, various other proteins\, such as BRCA1 and the MRE11–RAD50–NBS1 \(MRN\) complex\, which are recruited to the damaged site. Additionally\, ATM phosphorylates p53\, resulting in expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and leading to senescence or apoptosis. Somatic variants can result in inhibition or loss of these functions and can cause resistance to therapies that rely on inducing apoptosis via DSBs. Germline variants in A-T patients result in a predisposition to cancer\, most frequently hematologic or breast. PARP inhibition has been studied for its potential in treating ATM mutated breast cancer patients."

Variants that have been demonstrated to reduce the function of the protein have been shown to increase the risk for these cancers\, as well as prostate and pancreatic cancer. These findings have been the impetus for the increased popularity of genetic testing of healthy individuals to assess risk. Recent studies in ovarian cancer have also demonstrated that BRCA mutation status can predict treatment response. A number of trials assessing BRCA mutation status have shown an improved response to platinum agents\, and more recently has led to the FDA-approval of PARP inhibitors for BRCA-positive ovarian cancers. These studies have resulted in the Society of Gynecologic Oncology to recommend germline BRCA testing in all patients with a diagnosis of ovarian cancer."

PAX8 is expressed in 80-96% of all High-grade serous carcinomas \(HGSC\) and is commonly used as a marker for the disease. In addition PAX8 has become a useful biomarker for differentiating between mullerian mucinous and non-mullerian tumors. PAX8 has also been associated with neoplasms in the kidney and thyroid."

def: "Cyclin D has been shown in many cancer types to be misregulated. Well established for their oncogenic properties\, the cyclins and the cyclin-dependent kinases \(CDK's\) they activate have been the focus of major research and development efforts over the past decade. The methods by which the cyclins are misregulated are widely variable\, ranging from genomic amplification to changes in promoter methylation. While Cyclin D2 has only been found to be significantly deregulated in glioma\, Cyclin D1 in particular seems to be a pan-cancer actor. Cyclin D misregulation has been shown to lead to poorer outcomes in a number of studies\, and currently there are no FDA-approved targeted therapies."
