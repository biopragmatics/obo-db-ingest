# Rhea, the Annotated Reactions Database

 Rhea is an expert-curated knowledgebase of chemical and transport reactions of biological interest. Enzyme-catalyzed and spontaneously occurring reactions are curated from peer-reviewed literature and represented in a computationally tractable manner by using the ChEBI (Chemical Entities of Biological Interest) ontology to describe reaction participants.

Rhea covers the reactions described by the IUBMB Enzyme Nomenclature as well as many additional reactions and can be used for enzyme annotation, genome-scale metabolic modeling and omics-related analyses. Rhea is the standard for enzyme and transporter annotation in UniProtKB.
